	abstract = {Carbon and water exchanges between vegetated land surfaces and the atmosphere reveal the ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (WUE) of primary production. We examined the interacting influence of dominant plant functional groups (C-3 and C-4) and land-use history on WUEs of annual corn and perennial (restored prairie, switchgrass and smooth brome grass) grasslands in the US Midwest from 2010 through 2013. To this end, we determined ecosystem-level (eWUE) and intrinsic (iWUE) WUEs using eddy covariance and plant carbon isotope ratios, respectively. Corn, switchgrass, and restored prairie were each planted on lands previously managed as grasslands under the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), or as corn/soybean rotation under conventional agriculture (AGR), while a field of smooth brome grass remained in CRP management. The iWUEs of individual C-3 plant species varied little across years. Corn had the highest (4.1) and smooth brome grass the lowest (2.3) overall eWUEs (g C kg(-1) H2O) over the 4 years. Corn and switchgrass did not consistently show a significant difference in seasonal eWUE between former CRP and AGR lands, whereas restored prairie had significantly higher seasonal eWUE on former AGR than on former CRP land due to a greater shift from C-3 to C-4 species on the former AGR land following a drought in 2012. Thus, differences in grassland eWUE were largely determined by the relative dominance of C-3 and C-4 species within the plant communities. In this humid temperate climate with common short-term and occasional long-term droughts, it is likely that mixed grasslands will become increasingly dominated by C-4 grasses over time, with higher yields and eWUE than C-3 plants. These results inform models of the interaction between carbon and water cycles in grassland ecosystems under current and future climate and management scenarios.},

	abstract = {Interacting forces of climate change and increased human activity in the Arctic are driving rapid changes in ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity. One such change is the northern range expansion of tree species. We present the first account of the boreal tree species trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides, Salicaceae) growing beyond the latitudinal treeline in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska. The four trembling aspen stands described in this paper are located on abandoned gravel roads or pads created for construction purposes. We hypothesize that gravel pads create islands of substrate suitable for tree growth within the Arctic by providing greater rooting depth, well-drained microsites, an extended growing season, and acid-buffering capacity. Further, traffic along the south-to-north oriented Dalton Highway from the boreal forest in Interior Alaska to the Arctic may aid seed dispersal across the topographic barrier of the Brooks Range. Therefore, increased development in the Arctic will likely accelerate the establishment of trees as climate becomes more favorable for tree growth. Tree colonization associated with infrastructure development would contrast sharply with prior conceptual models of gradual treeline advance following disturbance.},

	abstract = {Global change models predict that high-latitude boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity as climate warms, possibly causing a positive feedback to warming through fire-driven emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. However, fire-climate feedbacks depend on forest regrowth and carbon (C) accumulation over the post-fire successional interval, which is influenced by nitrogen (N) availability. To improve our understanding of post-fire C and N accumulation patterns in boreal forests, we evaluated above-and belowground C and N pools within 70 stands throughout interior Alaska, a region predicted to undergo a shift in canopy dominance as fire severity increases. Stands represented gradients in age and successional trajectory, from black spruce (Picea mariana) self-replacement to species replacement by deciduous species of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Alaska paper birch (Betula neoalaskana). Stands undergoing deciduous trajectories stored proportionally more of their C and N in aboveground stemwood and had 5-7 times faster rates of aboveground net primary productivity of trees compared to stands undergoing a black spruce trajectory, which stored more of their C and N in the soil organic layer (SOL), a thick layer of mostly undecomposed mosses. Thus, as successional trajectories shift, total C and N pool sizes will remain relatively unchanged, but there will be a trade-off in pool location and a potential increase in C and N longevity due to decreased flammability and decomposition rates of deciduous stemwood. Despite often warmer, drier conditions in deciduous compared to black spruce stands, deciduous stemwood has a C: N around 10 times higher than the black spruce SOL and often remains standing for many years with reduced exposure to fungal decomposers. Thus, a fire-driven shift in successional trajectories could cause a negative feedback to climate warming because of increased pool longevity in deciduous trajectories.},

They mineralize organic carbon entering from terrestrial systems, evade terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO2), and generate and remove carbon through in-stream primary production and respiration. Despite their importance, headwater streams are often neglected in global carbon budgets primarily because of a lack of available data. We measured these processes, in detail, over a 10year period in a stream draining a 96ha forested watershed in western Oregon, USA. This stream, which represents only 0.4\% of the watershed area, exported 159kgCha(-1)yr(-1), similar to the global exports for large rivers. Stream export was dominated by downstream transport of dissolved inorganic carbon (63kgCha(-1)yr(-1)) and by evasion of CO2 to the atmosphere (42kgCha(-1)yr(-1)), leaving the remainder of 51kgCha(-1)yr(-1) for downstream transport of organic carbon (17kgCha(-1)yr(-1) and 34kgCha(-1)yr(-1) in dissolved and particulate form, respectively).},

We evaluated the influence of longterm and near-term nutrient input on aboveground and belowground carbon accumulation in seagrass beds, using a nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus) experiment embedded within a naturally occurring, long-term gradient of phosphorus availability within Florida Bay (USA). We measured organic carbon stocks in soils and above-and belowground seagrass biomass after 17 months of experimental nutrient addition. At the nutrient-limited sites, phosphorus addition increased the carbon stock in aboveground seagrass biomass by more than 300 \%; belowground seagrass carbon stock increased by 50-100 \%. Soil carbon content slightly decreased (similar to 10 \%) in response to phosphorus addition. There was a strong but non-linear relationship between soil carbon and Thalassia testudinum leaf nitrogen : phosphorus (N : P) or belowground seagrass carbon stock. When seagrass leaf N: P exceeded an approximate threshold of 75 : 1, or when belowground seagrass carbon stock was less than 100 g m(-2), there was less than 3\% organic carbon in the sediment. Despite the marked difference in soil carbon between phosphorus-limited and phosphorus-replete areas of Florida Bay, all areas of the bay had relatively high soil carbon stocks near or above the global median of 1.8\% organic carbon. The relatively high carbon content in the soils indicates that seagrass beds have extremely high carbon storage potential, even in nutrient-limited areas with low biomass or productivity.},

	abstract = {Leaf temperature is an elementary driver of plant physiology, ecology and ecosystem productivity. Individual leaf temperature may deviate strongly from air temperature, and may vary throughout the canopy. Measurements of leaf temperature, conducted at a high spatial and temporal resolution, can improve our understanding of leaf water loss, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rates, phenology, and atmosphere-ecosystem exchanges. However, continuous high-resolution measurement of leaf temperature outside of a controlled environment is difficult and rarely done. Here, thermal infrared cameras are used to measure leaf temperatures. We describe two long-term field measurement sites: one in a temperature deciduous forest, and the other in a subalpine conifer forest. The considerations and constraints for deploying such cameras are discussed and the temperature errors are typically +/-1 degrees C or smaller (sigma = 0.60 degrees C, 2 sigma = 1.20 degrees C). Lastly, we compare leaf temperature by species and height at hourly to multi-seasonal timescales and show that on average, leaf temperature is warmer than air temperature in a temperate forest. Leaf temperature can be uniform or heterogeneous across a scene, depending on canopy structure, leaf habit, and meteorology. With this data, we verify that leaf temperature follows classic expectations, yet exhibits noteworthy departures that require additional study and theoretical consideration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluate loads and associated errors to determine the best load estimation technique among three methods (a period-weighted approach, the regression-model method, and the composite method) based on a solute's concentration dynamics and sampling frequency. We evaluated a broad range of varying concentration dynamics with stream flow and season using four dissolved solutes (sulfate, silica, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon) at five diverse small watersheds (Sleepers River Research Watershed, VT; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH; Biscuit Brook Watershed, NY; Panola Mountain Research Watershed, GA; and Rio Mameyes Watershed, PR) with fairly high-frequency sampling during a 10- to 11-yr period. Data sets with three different sampling frequencies were derived from the full data set at each site (weekly plus storm/snowmelt events, weekly, and monthly) and errors in loads were assessed for the study period, annually, and monthly. For solutes that had a moderate to strong concentration-discharge relation, the composite method performed best, unless the autocorrelation of the model residuals was {\textless}0.2, in which case the regression-model method was most appropriate. For solutes that had a nonexistent or weak concentration-discharge relation (model R-2 {\textless} about 0.3), the period-weighted approach was most appropriate. The lowest errors in loads were achieved for solutes with the strongest concentration-discharge relations. Sample and regression model diagnostics could be used to approximate overall accuracies and annual precisions. For the period-weighed approach, errors were lower when the variance in concentrations was lower, the degree of autocorrelation in the concentrations was higher, and sampling frequency was higher. The period-weighted approach was most sensitive to sampling frequency. For the regression-model and composite methods, errors were lower when the variance in model residuals was lower. For the composite method, errors were lower when the autocorrelation in the residuals was higher. Guidelines to determine the best load estimation method based on solute concentration-discharge dynamics and diagnostics are presented, and should be applicable to other studies.},

	abstract = {Global concern regarding pollinator decline has intensified interest in enhancing pollinator resources in managed landscapes. These efforts frequently emphasize restoration or planting of flowering plants to provide pollen and nectar resources that are highly attractive to the desired pollinators. However, determining exactly which plant species should be used to enhance a landscape is difficult. Empirical screening of plants for such purposes is logistically daunting, but could be streamlined by crowdsourcing data to create lists of plants most probable to attract the desired pollinator taxa. People frequently photograph plants in bloom and the Internet has become a vast repository of such images. A proportion of these images also capture floral visitation by arthropods. Here, we test the hypothesis that the abundance of floral images containing identifiable pollinator and other beneficial insects is positively associated with the observed attractiveness of the same species in controlled field trials from previously published studies. We used Google Image searches to determine the correlation of pollinator visitation captured by photographs on the Internet relative to the attractiveness of the same species in common-garden field trials for 43 plant species. From the first 30 photographs, which successfully identified the plant, we recorded the number of Apis (managed honeybees), non-Apis (exclusively wild bees) and the number of bee-mimicking syrphid flies. We used these observations from search hits as well as bloom period (BP) as predictor variables in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for field-observed abundances of each of these groups. We found that non-Apis bees observed in controlled field trials were positively associated with observations of these taxa in Google Image searches (pseudo-R-2 of 0.668). Syrphid fly observations in the field were also associated with the frequency they were observed in images, but this relationship was weak. Apis bee observations were not associated with Internet images, but were slightly associated with BP. Our results suggest that passively crowdsourced image data can potentially be a useful screening tool to identify candidate plants for pollinator habitat restoration efforts directed at wild bee conservation. Increasing our understanding of the attractiveness of a greater diversity of plants increases the potential for more rapid and efficient research in creating pollinator-supportive landscapes.},

During this migration, striped bass spend significant time in estuaries and saltmarshes, presumably to forage. However, the extent to which saltmarsh productivity supports striped bass remains unresolved. We used a three-isotope Bayesian mixing model to determine the relative contribution of three primary producers [C4 saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina spp.), phytoplankton, and benthic diatoms] to striped bass tissue. Phytoplankton (51 \% contribution) and Spartina-derived sources (44 \% contribution) are the primary sources of production to striped bass, while benthic diatoms made a relatively small contribution (5 \%). Our results highlight the importance of saltmarshes to striped bass by showing that primary producers unique to saltmarsh ecosystems support a large proportion of striped bass production.},

BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r(2)=0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r(2)=0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r(2)=0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work.},

We briefly summarize the theoretical underpinnings and conceptual development of ecological forestry, before critically examining the roots and implications of its pervasive normative and ethical ambiguities. Without clarification, these ambiguities create conceptual challenges that preclude a clear understanding of what ecological forestry is or aspires to achieve, allowing for a problematic range of variability in how it can be applied.

	abstract = {Multiple models describe the formation and evolution of distinct microbial phylogenetic groups. These evolutionary models make different predictions regarding how adaptive alleles spread through populations and how genetic diversity is maintained. Processes predicted by competing evolutionary models, for example, genome-wide selective sweeps vs gene-specific sweeps, could be captured in natural populations using time-series metagenomics if the approach were applied over a sufficiently long time frame. Direct observations of either process would help resolve how distinct microbial groups evolve. Here, from a 9-year metagenomic study of a freshwater lake (2005-2013), we explore changes in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies and patterns of gene gain and loss in 30 bacterial populations. SNP analyses revealed substantial genetic heterogeneity within these populations, although the degree of heterogeneity varied by 41000-fold among populations. SNP allele frequencies also changed dramatically over time within some populations. Interestingly, nearly all SNP variants were slowly purged over several years from one population of green sulfur bacteria, while at the same time multiple genes either swept through or were lost from this population. These patterns were consistent with a genome-wide selective sweep in progress, a process predicted by the 'ecotype model' of speciation but not previously observed in nature. In contrast, other populations contained large, SNP-free genomic regions that appear to have swept independently through the populations prior to the study without purging diversity elsewhere in the genome. Evidence for both genome-wide and gene-specific sweeps suggests that different models of bacterial speciation may apply to different populations coexisting in the same environment.},

Two of the three species showed high levels of genetic divergence. Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, a widespread and common species, showed 7.6\% sequence divergence on opposite sides of the Mackay Glacier. The more range restricted C. nivicolus showed 4.0\% divergence among populations. The third species, A. monoculata, was found in only one location. Molecular clock estimates based on sequence divergences suggest that populations separated within the last 4 Mya. We conclude that habitat fragmentation resulting from Pliocene (5 Mya) and Pleistocene (2 Mya to 10 Kya) glaciations has promoted and maintained high levels of diversity among isolated springtail populations on relatively small spatial scales. The region surrounding the Mackay Glacier is likely to have provided refugia for springtail populations during glacial maxima and remains an area of high genetic and species diversity for Collembola within the Ross Sea region.

	abstract = {Variation in tree reproduction can alter forest community dynamics, especially if reproductive output is costly for other functions like growth. However, empirical studies reach conflicting conclusions about the constraints on reproductive allocation relative to growth and how they vary through time, across species, and between environments. Here, we test the hypothesis that a critical resource, canopy exposure to light availability, limits reproductive allocation by comparing long-term relationships between reproduction and growth for trees from 21 species in forests throughout the Southeastern United States. We found that species have divergent responses to light availability, with shade-intolerant species experiencing an alleviation of trade-offs at high light-and shade-tolerant species showing no changes in reproductive output across light environments. Correlations between temporal variation in individual growth and reproduction were weak and generally insensitive to canopy exposure, but changed when considering time lags. The diversity of responses across species indicates that reproductive allocation for trees in these forests is strongly influenced by both species' life history and environmental heterogeneity in space and time.},

	abstract = {Recent forest diebacks, combined with threats of future drought, focus attention on the extent to which tree death is caused by catastrophic events as opposed to chronic declines in health that accumulate over years. While recent attention has focused on large-scale diebacks, there is concern that increasing drought stress and chronic morbidity may have pervasive impacts on forest composition in many regions. Here we use long-term, whole-stand inventory data from southeastern U.S. forests to show that trees exposed to drought experience multiyear declines in growth prior to mortality. Following a severe, multiyear drought, 72\% of trees that did not recover their pre-drought growth rates died within 10 yr. This pattern was mediated by local moisture availability. As an index of morbidity prior to death, we calculated the difference in cumulative growth after drought relative to surviving conspecifics. The strength of drought-induced morbidity varied among species and was correlated with drought tolerance. These findings support the ability of trees to avoid death during drought events but indicate shifts that could occur over decades. Tree mortality following drought is predictable in these ecosystems based on growth declines, highlighting an opportunity to address multiyear drought-induced morbidity in models, experiments, and management decisions.},

Here we compare different models with a diverse sap flux data set to test the hypotheses that radial profiles differ by wood type and tree size. We show that radial variation in sap flux is dependent on wood type but independent of tree size for a range of temperate trees. The best-fitting model predicted out-of-sample sap flux observations and independent estimates of sapwood area with small errors, suggesting robustness in the new settings.

	abstract = {High-resolution biogenic and geologic proxies in which one increment or layer is formed per year are crucial to describing natural ranges of environmental variability in Earth's physical and biological systems. However, dating controls are necessary to ensure temporal precision and accuracy; simple counts cannot ensure that all layers are placed correctly in time. Originally developed for tree-ring data, crossdating is the only such procedure that ensures all increments have been assigned the correct calendar year of formation. Here, we use growth-increment data from two tree species, two marine bivalve species, and a marine fish species to illustrate sensitivity of environmental signals to modest dating error rates. When falsely added or missed increments are induced at one and five percent rates, errors propagate back through time and eliminate high-frequency variability, climate signals, and evidence of extreme events while incorrectly dating and distorting major disturbances or other low-frequency processes. Our consecutive Monte Carlo experiments show that inaccuracies begin to accumulate in as little as two decades and can remove all but decadal-scale processes after as little as two centuries. Real-world scenarios may have even greater consequence in the absence of crossdating. Given this sensitivity to signal loss, the fundamental tenets of crossdating must be applied to fully resolve environmental signals, a point we underscore as the frontiers of growth-increment analysis continue to expand into tropical, freshwater, and marine environments.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impacts of natural and human disturbances on forest biota is critical for improving forest management. Many studies have examined the separate impacts on fauna and flora of wildfire, conventional logging, and salvage logging, but empirical comparisons across a broad gradient of simultaneous disturbances are lacking. We quantified species richness and frequency of occurrence of vascular plants, and functional group responses, across a gradient of disturbances that occurred concurrently in 2009 in the mountain ash forests of southeastern Australia. Our study encompassed replicated sites in undisturbed forest (similar to 70 yr post fire), forest burned at low severity, forest burned at high severity, unburned forest that was clearcut logged, and forest burned at high severity that was clearcut salvage logged post-fire. All sites were sampled 2 and 3 yr post fire. Mean species richness decreased across the disturbance gradient from 30.1 species/site on low-severity burned sites and 28.9 species/site on high-severity burned sites, to 25.1 species/site on clearcut sites and 21.7 species/site on salvage logged sites. Low-severity burned sites were significantly more species-rich than clearcut sites and salvage logged sites; high-severity burned sites supported greater species richness than salvage logged sites. Specific traits influenced species' sensitivity to disturbance. Resprouting species dominated undisturbed mountain ash forests, but declined significantly across the gradient. Fern and midstory trees decreased significantly in frequency of occurrence across the gradient. Ferns (excluding bracken) decreased from 34\% of plants in undisturbed forest to 3\% on salvage logged sites. High-severity burned sites supported a greater frequency of occurrence and species richness of midstory trees compared to clearcut and salvage logged sites. Salvage logging supported fewer midstory trees than any other disturbance category, and were distinctly different from clearcut sites. Plant life form groups, including midstory trees, shrubs, and ferns, were dominated by very few species on logged sites. The differences in biotic response across the gradient of natural and human disturbances have significant management implications, particularly the need to reduce mechanical disturbance overall and to leave specific areas with no mechanical disturbance across the cut area during logging operations, to ensure the persistence of resprouting taxa.},

Emerging studies reveal that shrubs exhibit photosynthetic resource partitioning, akin to forests, that may need accounting for in the "big leaf" net ecosystem exchange models. We conducted a lab experiment on sun and shade leaves from S. pulchra shrubs to determine the influence of both constitutive (slowly changing bulk carotenoid and chlorophyll pools) and facultative (rapidly changing xanthophyll cycle) pigment pools on a suite of spectral vegetation indices, to devise a rapid means of estimating within canopy resource partitioning. We found that: (1) the PRI of dark-adapted shade leaves (PRIo) was double that of sun leaves, and that PRIo was sensitive to variation among sun and shade leaves in both xanthophyll cycle pool size (V + A + Z) (r(2) = 0.59) and Chla/b (r(2) = 0.64); (2) A corrected PRI (difference between dark and illuminated leaves, Delta PRI) was more sensitive to variation among sun and shade leaves in changes to the epoxidation state of their xanthophyll cycle pigments (dEPS) (r(2) = 0.78, RMSE = 0.007) compared to the uncorrected PRI of illuminated leaves (PRI) (r(2) = 0.34, RMSE = 0.02); and (3) the SR680 index was correlated with each of (V + A + Z), lutein, bulk carotenoids, (V + A + Z)/(Chla + b), and Chla/b (r(2) range = 0.52-0.69). We suggest that Delta PRI be employed as a proxy for facultative pigment dynamics, and the SR680 for the estimation of constitutive pigment pools. We contribute the first Arctic-specific information on disentangling PRI-pigment relationships, and offer insight into how spectral indices can assess resource partitioning within shrub tundra canopies.},

Our transferrable approach produces daily weather inputs by combining climate model projections and a stochastic weather generator, annual narrative-based watershed-scale LULC distributed spatially using transition rules, and annual manure and fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs based on current farm and livestock data that are consistent with each scenario narrative.

We developed two primary a priori hypotheses to examine relationships between three categories of wading bird prey biomass and covariates hypothesized to affect the concentration of aquatic fauna, a pulsed resource for breeding wading bird populations during the dry season. The fish concentration hypothesis proposed that local-scale processes concentrate wet-season fish biomass into patches in the dry season, whereas the fish production hypothesis states that the amount of dry-season fish biomass reflects fish biomass production during the preceding wet season. We sampled prey in drying pools at 405 sites throughout the Florida Everglades between December and May from 2006-2010 to test these hypotheses. The models that explained variation in dry-season fish biomass included water-level recession rate, wet-season biomass, microtopography, submerged vegetation, and the interaction between wet-season biomass and recession rate. Crayfish (Procambarus spp.) biomass was positively associated with wet-season crayfish biomass, moderate water depth, dense submerged aquatic vegetation, thin flocculent layer and a short interval of time since the last dry-down. Grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) biomass increased with increasing rates of water level recession, supporting our impression that shrimp, like fish, form seasonal concentrations. Strong support for wet-season fish and crayfish biomass in the top models confirmed the importance of wet-season standing stock to concentrations of fish and crayfish the following dry season. Additionally, the importance of recession rate and microtopography showed that local scale abiotic factors transformed fish production into the high quality foraging patches on which apex predators depended.},

In the subtropics, the passage of extreme cold spells functions as a major structuring force for ecological communities, and can incur substantial losses to biodiversity, agriculture, and infrastructure. If these events persist in the future, it is likely that their effects on subtropical communities and ecosystems will become more pronounced, as tropical species migrate poleward. Recent extreme cold spells in subtropical China (2008) and United States (2010) occurred in ecosystems that are the subject of long-term ecological study, enabling key questions about cold spell affects to be addressed. In this study, we (1) discuss the meteorological drivers that resulted in these two extreme cold spells, and (2) use findings from case studies published in the Ecosphere Special Feature on effects of extreme cold spells on the dynamics of subtropical communities, and on poleward expansion of tropical species and other previously published works to identify consistencies of subtropical community resilience and resistance to extreme cold spells. In this review, we highlight three consistent findings related to this particularly type of extreme climate event: (1) cold spells drive predictable community change in the subtropics by altering ratios of coexisting tropical and temperate species; (2) certain landscape features consistently affect subtropical resistance and resilience to extreme cold spells; and (3) native tropical species are more resistant and resilient to extreme cold spells than tropical nonnative taxa.

	abstract = {Permafrost soils contain more than 1300 Pg of carbon (C), twice the amount of C in the atmosphere. Temperatures in higher latitudes are increasing, inducing permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of previously frozen C, which will most likely feed back to climate warming through release of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. Understanding the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) and dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition under warming is essential to predict the future state of the climate system. Alaskan tundra soils from the discontinuous permafrost zone were exposed to in situ experimental warming for two consecutive winters, increasing soil temperature by 2.3 degrees C down to 40 cm in the soil profile. Soils obtained at three depths (0-15, 15-25 and 45-55 cm) from the experimental warming site were incubated under aerobic conditions at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C over 365 days in the laboratory. Carbon fluxes were measured periodically and dynamics of SOM decomposition, C pool sizes, and decay rates were estimated. Q(10) was estimated using both a short-term temperature manipulation (Q(10-ST)) performed at 14,100 and 280 days of incubation and via the equal C method (Q(10-EC), ratio of time taken for a soil to respire a given amount of degrees C), calculated continuously. At the same time points, functional diversities of the soil microbial communities were monitored for all incubation samples using a microbial functional gene array, GeoChip 5.0. Each array contains over 80,000 probes targeting microbial functional genes involved in biogeochemical cycling of major nutrients, remediation strategies, pathogenicity and other important environmental functions. Of these, over 20,000 probes target genes involved in the degradation of varying C substrates and can be used, to quantify the relative gene abundances and functional gene diversities related to soil organic matter turnover. The slow decomposing C pool (C-S), which represented close to 95\% of total C in the top 25 cm soils, had a higher Q(10) than the fast decomposing C pool (C-F) and also dominated the total amount of C released by the end of the incubation. Overall, C-S had temperature sensitivities of Q(10-ST) = 2.55 +/- 0.03 and Q(10-EC) = 2.19 +/- 0.13, while the CF had a temperature sensitivity of Q10-EC = 1.16 +/- 0.30. In contrast to the 15 degrees C incubations, the 25 degrees C microbial communities showed reduced diversities of C-degradation functional genes in the early stage of the incubations. However, as the incubations continued the 25 degrees C communities more closely paralleled the 15 degrees C communities with respect to the detection of microbial genes utilized in the degradation of labile to recalcitrant C substrates. Two winter seasons of experimental warming did not affect the dynamics and temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition or the microbial C-degradation genes during incubation. However, under the projected sustained warming attributable to climate change, we might expect increased contribution of C-S to organic matter decomposition. Because of the higher Q(10) and the large pool size of C-S, increased soil organic matter release under warmer temperatures will contribute towards accelerating climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Theory suggests that density-associated processes can modulate community resilience following declines in population size. Here, we demonstrate density-associated processes in two scleractinian populations on the outer reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, that are rapidly increasing in size following the effects of two catastrophic disturbances. Between 2006 and 2010, predation by the corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star reduced coral cover by 93 \%; in 2010, the dead coral skeletons were removed by a cyclone, and in 2011 and 2012, high coral recruitment initiated population recovery. Coral recruitment was associated with coral cover, but the relationship differed between two coral genera that are almost exclusively broadcast spawners in Moorea. Acroporids recruited at low densities, and the density of recruits was positively associated with cover of Acropora, whereas pocilloporids recruited at high densities, and densities of their recruits were negatively associated with cover of Pocillopora. Together, our results suggest that associations between adult cover and density of both juveniles and recruits can mediate rapid coral community recovery after large disturbances. The difference between taxa in sign of the relationships between recruit density and coral cover indicate that they reflect contrasting mechanisms with the potential to mediate temporal shifts in taxonomic composition of coral communities.},

These indices from experimentally weathered particles were compared to microplastic particles collected from oceanic surface waters in the California Current, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transition region between the two, in order to estimate the exposure time of the oceanic plastics. Although chemical bonds exhibited some nonlinear changes with environmental exposure, they can potentially approximate the weathering time of some plastics, especially high-density polyethylene. The majority of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre polyethylene particles we measured have inferred exposure times {\textgreater} 18 months, with some {\textgreater}30 months. Inferred particle weathering times are consistent with ocean circulation models suggesting a long residence time in the open ocean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Profiling buoys with automated winches and sensors that collect high-frequency chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) profiles in 11 lakes in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) allowed the study of the vertical and temporal distribution of ChlF, including the formation of subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SSCM). The effectiveness of 3 methods for sampling phytoplankton distributions in lakes, including (1) manual profiles, (2) single-depth buoys, and (3) profiling buoys were assessed. High-frequency ChlF surface data and profiles were compared to predictions from the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. The depth-integrated ChlF dynamics measured by the profiling buoy data revealed a greater complexity that neither conventional sampling nor the generalized PEG model captured. Conventional sampling techniques would have missed SSCM in 7 of 11 study lakes. Although surface-only ChlF data underestimated average water column ChlF, at times by nearly 2-fold in 4 of the lakes, overall there was a remarkable similarity between surface and mean water column data. Contrary to the PEG model's proposed negligible role for physical control of phytoplankton during the growing season, thermal structure and light availability were closely associated with ChlF seasonal depth distribution. Thus, an extension of the PEG model is proposed, with a new conceptual framework that explicitly includes physical metrics to better predict SSCM formation in lakes and highlight when profiling buoys are especially informative.},

Shifting interactions warrant analysis because they can influence cultural practices and food security of northern societies. We collaborated with four indigenous communities in Alaska and conducted semi-directed interviews with 71 experienced harvesters to identify local perceptions of climate-driven trends in the environment, and describe the effects of those trends on the availability (i.e., abundance, distribution, accessibility) of subsistence resources. We then linked local perceptions with scientific climate projections to forecast how availability of subsistence resources may change in the future. Hunters identified 47 important relationships between climate-driven changes in the environment and availability of subsistence resources. Of those relationships, 60, 28, and 13 \% focused on changes in harvester access, resource distribution, and resource abundance, respectively. Our forecast model indicated a net reduction in the availability of subsistence resources over the next 30 years. The reduction was caused primarily by climate-related challenges in access, rather than changes in abundance or distribution of resources. Our study demonstrates how giving insufficient attention to harvester access may produce misleading conclusions when assessing the impacts of climate change on future subsistence opportunities.},

Corals were collected from the shallow back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, and were incubated under orthogonal contrasts of 408 and 913 mu atm pCO(2), and 28.0 and 30.1 degrees C. After 19 days in these treatments, calcification of P. meandrina was reduced 55 \% at 913 mu atm pCO(2) and 30.1 degrees C, but the calcification of the other three taxa was unaffected by high pCO(2) at 30.1 degrees C; the calcification of all taxa was unaffected by high pCO(2) at 28.0 degrees C. These results show that P. meandrina (Robusta) was strongly and negatively affected by OA, whereas A. pulchra and massive Porites spp. (Complexa) and M. platyphylla (milleporine) were unaffected by OA. The assignment of these taxa to different clades suggests that evolutionary constraints could play a role in determining the sensitivity of cnidarian calcification to OA.},

Here we use cultivation-independent quantitative ecological and metagenomic assays, combined with new comparative bioinformatic techniques, to investigate double-stranded DNA viruses during the WAP spring-summer transition. This study demonstrates that (i) temperate viruses dominate this region, switching from lysogeny to lytic replication as bacterial production increases, and (ii) Southern Ocean viral assemblages are genetically distinct from lower-latitude assemblages, primarily driven by this temperate viral dominance. This new information suggests fundamentally different virus-host interactions in polar environments, where intense seasonal changes in bacterial production select for temperate viruses because of increased fitness imparted by the ability to switch replication strategies in response to resource availability. Further, temperate viral dominance may provide mechanisms (for example, bacterial mortality resulting from prophage induction) that help explain observed temporal delays between, and lower ratios of, bacterial and primary production in polar versus lower-latitude marine ecosystems. Together these results suggest that temperate virus-host interactions are critical to predicting changes in microbial dynamics brought on by warming in polar marine systems.},

This region is on the threshold of anticipated climate change, with glacial melt, permafrost thaw, and the melting of massive buried ice increasing liquid water availability and mobilizing soil nutrients. Experimental water and organic matter (OM) amendments were applied to investigate how these climate change effects may impact the soil communities. To identify active taxa and their functions, total community RNA transcripts were sequenced and annotated, and amended soils were compared with unamended control soils using differential abundance and expression analyses. Overall, taxonomic diversity declined with amendments of water and OM. The domain Bacteria increased with both amendments while Eukaryota declined from 38\% of all taxa in control soils to 8 and 11\% in water and OM amended soils, respectively. Among bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria (59\%) dominated water-amended soils and Firmicutes (45\%) dominated OM amended soils. Three bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes) were primarily responsible for the observed positive functional responses, while eukaryotic taxa experienced the majority (27 of 34) of significant transcript losses. These results indicated that as climate changes in this region, a replacement of endemic taxa adapted to dry, oligotrophic conditions by generalist, copiotrophic taxa is likely.},

The community Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) is unique in that it is the next-generation land surface model for the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and for the operational weather/climate models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. In this study, we add a capability to Noah-MP to simulate nitrogen dynamics by coupling the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) plant model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) soil nitrogen dynamics. This model development incorporates FUN's state-of-the-art concept of carbon cost theory and SWAT's strength in representing the impacts of agricultural management on the nitrogen cycle. Parameterizations for direct root and mycorrhizal-associated nitrogen uptake, leaf retranslocation, and symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation are employed from FUN, while parameterizations for nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching are based on SWAT. The coupled model is then evaluated at the Kellogg Biological Station - a Long Term Ecological Research site within the US Corn Belt. Results show that the model performs well in capturing the major nitrogen state/flux variables (e.g., soil nitrate and nitrate leaching). Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen dynamics improves the modeling of net primary productivity and evapotranspiration. The model improvement is expected to advance the capability of Noah-MP to simultaneously predict weather and water quality in fully coupled Earth system models.},

Here, we used 76years of water yield, climate, and field plot vegetation measurements in six unmanaged, reference watersheds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, USA to determine whether water yield has changed over time, and to examine and attribute the causal mechanisms of change. We found that annual water yield increased in some watersheds from 1938 to the mid-1970s by as much as 55\%, but this was followed by decreases up to 22\% by 2013. Changes in forest evapotranspiration were consistent with, but opposite in direction to the changes in water yield, with decreases in evapotranspiration up to 31\% by the mid-1970s followed by increases up to 29\% until 2013. Vegetation survey data showed commensurate reductions in forest basal area until the mid-1970s and increases since that time accompanied by a shift in dominance from xerophytic oak and hickory species to several mesophytic species (i.e., mesophication) that use relatively more water. These changes in forest structure and species composition may have decreased water yield by as much as 18\% in a given year since the mid-1970s after accounting for climate. Our results suggest that changes in climate and forest structure and species composition in unmanaged forests brought about by disturbance and natural community dynamics over time can result in large changes in water supply.},

Surprisingly, although inputs to and outputs from ecosystems are instrumental to understanding sources and sinks of nutrients and other elements, uncertainty in these fluxes is rarely reported in ecosystem budgets. We illustrate error propagation in input-output budgets by comparing the net hydrologic flux of Ca in a harvested and reference watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. We identify sources of uncertainty and use a Monte Carlo approach to combine many sources of uncertainty to produce an estimate of overall uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty in precipitation inputs included in this study were: rain gage efficiency (undercatch or overcatch), gaps in measurements of precipitation volume, selection of a model for interpolating among rain gages, unusable precipitation chemistry, and chemical analysis. Sources of uncertainty in stream water outputs were: stage height-discharge relationship, watershed area, gaps in the stream flow record, chemical analysis, and the selection of a method for flux calculation. The annual net hydrologic flux of Ca in the harvested and reference watersheds was calculated from 1973 through 2009. Relative to the reference watershed, the harvested watershed showed a marked increase in Ca flux after it was cut in 1983-1984, and slowly declined toward pretreatment levels thereafter. In 2009, the last year evaluated, the 95\% confidence intervals for the annual estimates approach the 95\% confidence intervals of the pretreatment regression line, suggesting that the increased net loss of Ca in the harvested watershed may soon be indistinguishable from the reference. Identifying the greatest sources of uncertainty can be used to guide improvements, for example in reducing instances of unusable precipitation chemistry and gaps in stream runoff. Our results highlight the value of estimating uncertainty in watershed studies, including those in which replication is impractical.},

While phytoplankton seasonal succession within a year has been described for many lakes, much less is known about variability in seasonal succession over multiple years. Here, we describe how continuous wavelet transforms can be used to identify variation in the periodicity in phytoplankton time series at multiple timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we analyzed 16 years of biweekly phytoplankton data from eutrophic Lake Mendota, USA, that coincided with substantial variability in climate and nutrient loading. Throughout the time series, the wavelet transforms identified the annual scale as the dominant scale of variation in aggregated phytoplankton, except for a 3-year period when there was no significant dominant scale. This period coincided with drought and decreased nutrient loading. During this time, phytoplankton biomass was markedly lower, and the phytoplankton community exhibited a unimodal, not bimodal, pattern of seasonal succession. Our results highlight the utility of wavelet techniques for identifying changes in seasonal succession in long-term phytoplankton records, which are becoming more available for many lakes. As aquatic ecosystems increasingly experience exogenous forcings at multiple timescales, wavelet analyses provide a powerful tool for determining how phytoplankton communities may respond.},

	abstract = {In shallow coastal bays where nutrient loading and riverine inputs are low, turbidity, and the consequent light environment are controlled by resuspension of bed sediments due to wind-waves and tidal currents. High sediment resuspension and low light environments can limit benthic primary productivity; however, both currents and waves are affected by the presence of benthic plants such as seagrass. This feedback between the presence of benthic primary producers such as seagrass and the consequent light environment has been predicted to induce bistable dynamics locally. However, these vegetated areas influence a larger area than they footprint, including a barren adjacent downstream area which exhibits reduced shear stresses. Here we explore through modeling how the patchy structure of seagrass meadows on a landscape may affect sediment resuspension and the consequent light environment due to the presence of this sheltered region. Heterogeneous vegetation covers comprising a mosaic of randomly distributed patches were generated to investigate the effect of patch modified hydrodynamics. Actual cover of vegetation on the landscape was used to facilitate comparisons across landscape realizations. Hourly wave and current shear stresses on the landscape along with suspended sediment concentration and light attenuation characteristics were then calculated and spatially averaged to examine how actual cover and mean water depth affect the bulk sediment and light environment. The results indicate that an effective cover, which incorporates the sheltering area, has important controls on the distributions of shear stress, suspended sediment, light environment, and consequent seagrass habitat suitability. Interestingly, an optimal habitat occurs within a depth range where, if actual cover is reduced past some threshold, the bulk light environment would no longer favor seagrass growth.

One interesting avenue of research in ecology is exploring whether spatial statistical methods can be brought to bear on such spatial patterns of forest structure to gain insight into the possible ecological processes that created them. In this study we applied a relatively new method to ecology, codispersion analysis, to investigate spatial covariation between two common measures of forest structure: tree abundance and mean basal area. We used data for four focal tree species from both a simulated and a real forest sampled at multiple time points. We assessed the significance of observed codispersion patterns using null models, in which tree diameters were iteratively and randomly reassigned to trees whose locations were kept constant. The results suggest that codispersion analysis could detect a range of spatial patterns in forest stand structure that were indicative of changing ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Lake Vanda is a perennially ice-covered, meromictic, endorheic lake located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, and an exceptional sentinel of climate change within the region. Lake levels rose 15 m over the past 68 years in response to climate-driven variability in ice-cover sublimation, meltwater production, and annual discharge of the Onyx River, the main source of water to the lake. Evidence from a new bathymetric map and water balance model combined with annual growth laminations in benthic mats suggest that the most recent filling trend began abruptly 80 years ago, in the early 1930s. This change increased lake volume by {\textgreater}50\%, triggered the formation of a new, upper, thermohaline convection cell, and cooled the lower convection cell by at least 2 degrees C and the bottom-most waters by at {\textgreater}4 degrees C Additionally, the depth of the deep chlorophyll a maximum rose by {\textgreater}2 m, and deep-growing benthic algal mats declined while shallow benthic mats colonized freshly inundated areas. We attribute changes in hydrology to regional variations in air flow related to the strength and position of the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) pressure system which have increased the frequency of down-valley, fohn winds associated with surface air temperature warming in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The ASL has also been implicated in the recent warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and provides a common link for climate-related change on opposite sides of the continent. If this trend persists, Lake Vanda should continue to rise and cool over the next 200 years until a new equilibrium lake level is achieved. Most likely, future lake rise will lead to isothermal conditions not conducive to thermohaline convection, resulting in a drastically different physical, biogeochemical, and biological structure than observed today.

	abstract = {Behaviour often regulates population responses to environmental change, but linking behavioural responses to population patterns can be challenging because behavioural responses are often context-dependent, have an instinctive component, and yet may be modified by experience. Black-bellied Salamanders (Desmognathus quadramaculatus (Holbrook, 1840)) occupy forested streams where dense canopies create cool, dark environments. Because riparian deforestation negatively affects salamander-population connectivity yet some individuals choose to persist in these gaps, we sought to evaluate whether phototaxis could explain these patterns and whether phototactic behaviour would be influenced by experience (capture from forested or deforested areas) or context (refuge type and availability). Our results demonstrated that larval D. quadramaculatus exhibited negative phototaxis, but that larvae from forested streams exhibited stronger negative phototaxis than individuals from deforested streams. Larvae also selected habitat closer to light when refuge was available. Our results show that light alters habitat use by larval D. quadramaculatus, but the magnitude of that effect depends on refuge availability and experience with well-lit conditions associated with forest removal. As human activities reduce canopy cover and refuge availability, negative phototaxis may be one explanation for behavioural barriers to movement. Ultimately, the ability of salamanders to exhibit behavioural plasticity will determine their potential for local adaptation facilitating persistence in the face of environmental change.},

	abstract = {Spatial variation in abundance is influenced by local- and landscape-level environmental variables, but modeling landscape effects is challenging because the spatial scales of the relationships are unknown. Current approaches involve buffering survey locations with polygons of various sizes and using model selection to identify the best scale. The buffering approach does not acknowledge that the influence of surrounding landscape features should diminish with distance, and it does not yield an estimate of the unknown scale parameters. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach that allows for statistical inference about the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance. Our method uses smoothing kernels to average landscape variables around focal sites and uses maximum likelihood to estimate the scale parameters of the kernels and the effects of the smoothed variables on abundance. We assessed model performance using a simulation study and an avian point count dataset. The simulation study demonstrated that estimators are unbiased and produce correct confidence interval coverage except in the rare case in which there is little spatial autocorrelation in the landscape variable. Canada warbler abundance was more highly correlated with site-level measures of NDVI than landscape-level NDVI, but the reverse was true for elevation. Canada warbler abundance was highest when elevation in the surrounding landscape, defined by an estimated Gaussian kernel, was between 1300 and 1400 m. Our method provides a rigorous way of formally estimating the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance, and it can be embedded within most classes of statistical models.},

We used the MPP to explore the thermodynamic basis for microbial processes and greenhouse gas fluxes in high latitude peat soils. Increasing temperatures cause extensive areas of permafrost degradation, which can lead to wetland formation, though permafrost degradation and aggradation can be cyclical under the right conditions. Differential ecosystem responses to permafrost degradation offer an opportunity to use the unifying approach of thermodynamics. We used adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in peat soils as a soil-relevant proxy for power to test the MPP along a chronosequence of wetlands with time following permafrost degradation. We conducted soil incubation experiments and measured production rates of CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ATP. ATP production was significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) in the young bog soils compared to the undisturbed permafrost bog soils; rates in the older bog soils were not different from either site. Our results suggest that power output increased following recovery from permafrost thaw. A unifying vantage point provided by thermodynamics may be useful in other investigations of wetland ecosystems with unpredictable responses to disturbance.},

Although these principles have conceptual overlap, we found considerable differences in their historical development, the disciplines that apply these principles, and their adoption in the literature. These principles were more similar than dissimilar, and the maximization of power in ecosystems occurs with maximum entropy production. These principles have great potential to explain how systems develop, organize, and function, but there are no widely agreed-on theoretical derivations for the MEPP and MPP, hindering their broader use in ecological research. We end with recommendations for how ecosystems-level studies may better use these principles.},

In this study, a suite of biomass and soil leachates together with surface water samples from the Florida coastal Everglades (FCE) were investigated to quantitatively assess the photo- and bio-reactivity of DOM via dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet-visible absorbance (UV-Vis) measurements, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The decomposition patterns observed were diverse, but dominated by first order decay for most of the samples studied. The reactivity rate constants obtained based on a first order multi-pool kinetic model, suggest that the DOM in the Everglades is largely refractory on time scales relevant to this ecosystem (2 months). The relative reactivity of different fluorescent DOM pools determined as labile, semi-labile and refractory were in the order of biomass leachate {\textgreater} soil leachate {\textgreater} surface water. Photo-reactivity was found to be a more important process in controlling the fate of FDOM in this system, while FDOM was mainly refractory to bio-degradation. Degradation patterns and rate constants for samples of different origin displayed vast differences for the same PARAFAC component, suggesting a complex and heterogeneous composition of fluorophores for each component, most likely the result of different structures, speciation and conformation, and molecular weight distribution. In addition, a terrestrial humic-like and two protein-like components were found to have the potential to serve as indicators of photo-degradable and bioavailable DOM.},

In head-to-head comparison (using satellite data from 2003 to 2013 for validation) for model grid cells over the Northern Hemisphere deciduous broadleaf forests (5.5 million km(2)), we found that the revised model substantially outperformed the standard CLM seasonal-deciduous spring phenology submodel at both coarse (0.9 9 1.25 degrees) and fine (1 km) scales. The revised model also does a better job of representing recent (decadal) phenological trends observed globally by MODIS, as well as long-term trends (1950-2014) in the PEP725 European phenology dataset. Moreover, forward model runs suggested a stronger advancement (up to 11 days) of spring leaf-out by the end of the 21st century for the revised model. Trends toward earlier advancement are predicted for deciduous forests across the whole Northern Hemisphere boreal and temperate deciduous forest region for the revised model, whereas the standard model predicts earlier leaf-out in colder regions, but later leaf-out in warmer regions, and no trend globally. The earlier spring leaf-out predicted by the revised model resulted in enhanced gross primary production (up to 0.6 Pg C yr(-1)) and evapotranspiration (up to 24 mm yr(-1)) when results were integrated across the study region. These results suggest that the standard seasonal-deciduous submodel in CLM should be reconsidered, otherwise substantial errors in predictions of key land-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks may result.},

As they propagate westward across the shelf, cyclonic eddies efficiently transport coastal planktonic organisms and maintain locally elevated production for up to 1year (800km offshore). Anticyclonic eddies, on the other hand, have a limited impact on local production over their similar to 6month lifetime as they propagate 400km offshore. At any given time similar to 8\% of the model domain was covered by eddy cores. Though the eddies cover a small area, they explain similar to 50 and 20\% of the transport of nitrate and plankton, respectively.},

I develop a model-based approach that separates these effects on trait diversity. Application to USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern United States demonstrates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, information than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dominated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity. There is substantial variation in environmental control on trait patterns, between traits and regionally. In terms of environmental response traits do not aggregate into defined plant functional types, as would be desirable for models.},

In this case study, we employed a multidisciplinary methodology for exploring agroecosystern sustainability by using eddy covariance (EC) data to compute thermodynamic entropy production (sigma) and relate it to water, energy and carbon cycling in croplands and grasslands of the Central US. From 2002 to 2012, the biophysical metric of sigma was compared across AmeriFlux sites, each with site-specific land management practices of irrigation, crop rotation, and tillage. Results show that sigma is most correlated with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon, and when cropland and grassland sites are close to being carbon neutral, a values range from 0.51-1.0W K-1 m(-2) for grasslands, 0.81-1.0 W K-1 m(-2) for rainfed croplands, and 0.81-1.1W K-1 m(-2) for irrigated croplands. Irrigated maize stressed by hydrologic and high temperature anomalies associated with the 2012 drought exhibit the greatest increase in a, indicating the possibility of decreased sustainability compared to rainfed croplands and grasslands. These results suggest that maximizing carbon uptake with irrigation and fertilizer use tends to move agroecosystems further away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which has implications for ecological sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in climate-smart agriculture. The underlying theoretical concepts, multidisciplinary methodology, and use of eddy covariance data for biophysical indicators in this study contribute to a unique understanding of ecological sustainability in agricultural systems.

However, most studies have evaluated the response of organisms to two or three temperature treatments, which does not allow the functional relationship between calcification and temperature under ambient and future pCO(2) to be determined. This study tested the hypothesis that the relationship between calcification and temperature is affected by OA in the coral Acropora pulchra and the calcified alga Lithophyllum kotschyanum. Pieces of each organism were incubated under five (24-30 A degrees C) or six (24-31.5 A degrees C) temperatures crossed with two pCO(2) levels (400 and 1000 mu atm), and calcification was assessed in trials conducted in the spring and summer. The response of coral calcification to temperature was a positive asymmetric parabola with a maximum at similar to 28 A degrees C under both pCO(2) levels and in both seasons; the effects of pCO(2) on calcification were largest at similar to 28 A degrees C and lowest in both cool and warm temperatures. In contrast, calcification of the alga at both levels of pCO(2) was unaffected by temperature in spring, but declined linearly with temperature in summer. This study demonstrates that the calcification response of coral reef organisms to the crossed effect of warming and OA is complex and cannot be fully assessed without using multiple temperature treatments that are ecologically relevant.},

The effects of OA on outer barrier reefs, which are the most striking of coral reef habitats and are functionally and physically different from back reefs, are unknown. Using 5-m long outdoor flumes to create treatment conditions, we constructed coral reef communities comprised of calcified algae, corals, and reef pavement that were assembled to match the community structure at 17m depth on the outer barrier reef of Moorea, French Polynesia. Communities were maintained under ambient and 1200atm pCO(2) for 7weeks, and net calcification rates were measured at different flow speeds. Community net calcification was significantly affected by OA, especially at night when net calcification was depressed similar to 78\% compared to ambient pCO(2). Flow speed (2-14cms(-1)) enhanced net calcification only at night under elevated pCO(2). Reef pavement also was affected by OA, with dissolution similar to 86\% higher under elevated pCO(2) compared to ambient pCO(2). These results suggest that net accretion of outer barrier reef communities will decline under OA conditions predicted within the next 100years, largely because of increased dissolution of reef pavement. Such extensive dissolution poses a threat to the carbonate foundation of barrier reef communities.},

Water samples were collected monthly from the stream and a well network during base flow periods. We examined the potential for mixing of different source waters to explain concentrations of DOC and DIC. We did not find convincing evidence that either inputs of deep groundwater or lateral inputs of shallow soil water influenced carbon dynamics. Rather, carbon dynamics appeared to be controlled by local processes in the hyporheic zone and overlying riparian soils. DOC concentrations were low in stream water (0.04-0.09 mM), and decreased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.02-0.04 mM lost over 100 h). Conversely, stream water DIC concentrations were much greater than DOC (0.35-0.7 mM) and increased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.2-0.4 mM gained over 100 h). DOC in stream water could only account for 10\% of the observed increase in DIC. In situ metabolic processing of buried particulate organic matter as well as advection of CO2 from the vadose zone likely accounted for the remaining 90\% of the increase in DIC. Overall, the hyporheic zone was a source of DIC to the stream. We suggest that, in mountain stream networks, hyporheic exchange facilitates the transformation of particulate organic carbon buried in floodplains and transports the DIC that is produced back to the stream where it can be evaded to the atmosphere.},

Patterns and controls of CH4 in fluvial ecosystems remain relatively poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known regarding how major human impacts to fluvial ecosystems may be transforming their role as CH4 producers and emitters. Here, we examine the consequences of two distinct ecosystem changes as a result of human land use: increased nutrient loading (primarily as nitrate), and increased sediment loading and deposition of fine particles in the benthic zone. We did not find support for the hypothesis that enhanced nitrate loading down-regulates methane production via thermodynamic or toxic effects. We did find strong evidence that increased sedimentation and enhanced organic matter content of the benthos lead to greater methane production (diffusive + ebullitive flux) relative to pristine fluvial systems in northern Wisconsin (upper Midwest, USA). Overall, streams in a human-dominated landscape of southern Wisconsin were major regional sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, equivalent to similar to 20\% of dairy cattle emissions, or similar to 50\% of a landfill's annual emissions. We suggest that restoration of the benthic environment (reduced fine deposits) could lead to reduced CH4 emissions, while decreasing nutrient loading is likely to have limited impacts to this ecosystem process.},

Using high-resolution, spatially resolved water quality sensor measurements along 1385 river kilometers, we show that primary productivity and organic matter accumulation affect river carbon dioxide and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Phytoplankton drive CO2 to near or below atmospheric equilibrium during the growing season, while anaerobic carbon oxidation supports a large proportion of the CO2 and CH4 production. Reductions of suspended sediment load, absent of dramatic reductions in nutrients, will likely further reduce net CO2 emissions from the river. Large river pools, like Lake Pepin, which removes the majority of upstream sediments, and large agricultural tributaries downstream that deliver significant quantities of sediments and nutrients, are likely to persist as major geographical drivers of greenhouse gas emissions.},

The present study examines the distribution of organic carbon (OC) between particle size fractions in near-surface (0-0.05 m) soil and the water erosion-induced redistribution of particle-associated OC over a grass-shrub ecotone, in a semiarid landscape, subject to land degradation. Coarse ({\textgreater}2mm) particles have comparable average OC concentrations to the fine ({\textless}2mm) particles, accounting for similar to 24-38\% of the OC stock in the near-surface soil. This may be due to aggregate stabilization by precipitated calcium carbonate in these calcareous arid soils. Critically, standard protocols assuming that coarse fraction particles contain no OC are likely to underestimate soil OC stocks substantially, especially in soils with strongly stabilized aggregates. Sediment eroded from four hillslope scale (10 x 30m) sites during rainstorm events was monitored over four annual monsoon seasons. Eroded sediment was significantly enriched in OC; enrichment increased significantly across the grass-shrub ecotone and appears to be an enduring phenomenon probably sustained through the dynamic replacement of preferentially removed organic matter. The average erosion-induced OC event yield increased sixfold across the ecotone from grass-dominated to shrub-dominated ecosystems, due to both greater erosion and greater OC enrichment. This erosional pathway is rarely considered when comparing the carbon budgets of grasslands and shrublands, yet this accelerated efflux of OC may be important for long-term carbon storage potentials of dryland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Photosynthetic microbial communities are important to the functioning of early successional ecosystems, but we know very little about the factors that limit the growth of these communities, especially in remote glacial and periglacial environments. The goal of the present study was to gain insight into the degree to which nutrients limit the growth of photosynthetic microbes in sediments from the surface of the Toklat Glacier in central Alaska. Previous studies and historical observations indicated that this environment is dominated by unique soil algae, and that succession from a microbial to a plant dominated system is very slow. We used a soil microcosm approach to determine if nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) additions would affect the development and final biomass of microbial phototroph communities in this system. We found that fertilization with P significantly increased the exponential growth rate (r), but P alone did not affect the final percent soil cover (K) by microbial phototrophs. Nitrogen alone had no effect on either r or K, but the combination of P and N dramatically increased K, thus showing that algal growth rate in this system is likely P-limited, but total productivity may be co-limited by P and N. In addition, nutrient treatments differentially stimulated microbial groups resulting in significantly different microbial communities among treatments. Overall, these results give a preliminary indication of the factors that might limit the development and productivity of photosynthetic microbial communities in an extreme and remote glacial system.

	abstract = {Mechanisms of ecosystem change in urbanizing landscapes are poorly understood, especially in exurban areas featuring residential or commercial development set in a matrix of modified and natural vegetation. We asked how development altered trophic interactions and ecosystem processes in the matrix. We examined the effect of varying degrees of exurban development (housing density) on a trophic system that included an apex mammalian predator (coyote, Canis latrans), mammalian herbivores (lagomorphs and rodents), and herbaceous plants. We tested the hypothesis that plant recruitment would be negatively affected by exurban development due either to increases in herbivores associated with increased resource availability (a bottom-up effect) or to a reduction in predators that avoid humans (a top-down effect). In Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA, four replicate sites were located in each of three urbanization levels: high density exurban, low density exurban, and wildland dominated by Chihuahuan Desert vegetation. Seedling trays measured herbivory rates, live trapping estimated abundance of pocket mice and kangaroo rats, and remotely-triggered wildlife cameras estimated the activity of lagomorphs and coyotes. Increased herbivory on seedlings and decreased herbaceous plant recruitment were observed in high density exurban areas. Overall rodent abundance, seed consumption rates, and activity of the lagomorph Lepus californicus did not vary with urbanization level. Activity by another lagomorph, Sylvilagus audubonii, and coyotes was highest in dense exurban areas, consistent with a bottom-up effect. Exurban development can have important indirect effects on trophic interactions occurring in adjacent, untransformed ecosystems. Similar to earlier studies, such effects in the Chihuahuan Desert may be mediated by bottom-up processes associated with anthropogenic inputs.},

	abstract = {When faced with a stressor, vertebrates can rapidly increase the secretion of glucocorticoids, which is thought to improve the chances of survival. Concurrent changes in other physiological systems, such as the reproductive endocrine or innate immune systems, have received less attention, particularly in wild vertebrates. It is often thought that glucocorticoids directly modulate immune performance during a stress response, but, in many species, androgens also rapidly respond to stress. However, to our knowledge, no study has simultaneously examined the interactions between the glucocorticoid, androgen, and innate immune responses to stress in a wild vertebrate. To address this issue, we tested the hypothesis that the change in plasma corticosterone (CORT) in response to the acute stress of capture and restraint is correlated with the concurrent changes in plasma testosterone (T) and innate immune performance (estimated by the capacity of plasma to agglutinate and lyse foreign cells) in the Abert's Towhee (Melozone aberti). Furthermore, to broaden the generality of the findings, we compared male and female towhees, as well as males from urban and non-urban populations. Acute stress increased plasma CORT, decreased plasma T in males, and decreased innate immune performance, but the increase in CORT during stress was not correlated with the corresponding decreases in either plasma T or innate immunity. By contrast, the plasma T stress response was positively correlated with the innate immune stress response. Collectively, our results challenge the proposition that the glucocorticoid stress response is correlated with the concurrent changes in plasma T, a key reproductive hormone, and innate immunity, as estimated by agglutination and lysis.},

	abstract = {Birds often adjust to urban areas by advancing the timing (phenology) of vernal gonad growth. However, the ecological and physiological bases of this adjustment are unclear. We tested whether the habitat related disparity in gonad growth phenology of male Abert's towhees, Melozone aberti, is due to greater food availability in urban areas of Phoenix, Arizona USA or, alternatively, a habitat-related difference in the phenology of key food types. To better understand the physiological mechanism underlying variation in gonad growth phenology, we compared the activity of the reproductive system at all levels of hypotha lamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. We found no habitat-associated difference in food availability (ground arthropod biomass), but, in contrast to the seasonal growth of leaves on desert trees, the leaf foliage of urban trees was already developed at the beginning of our study. Multiple estimates of energetic status did not significantly differ between the non-urban and urban towhees during three years that differed in the habitat-related disparity in gonad growth and winter precipitation levels. Thus, our results provide no support for the hypothesis that greater food abundance in urban areas of Phoenix drives the habitat-related disparity in gonad growth phenology in Abert's towhees. By contrast, they suggest that differences in the predictability and magnitude of change in food availability between urban and desert areas of Phoenix contribute to the observed habitat-related disparity in gonad growth. Endocrine responsiveness of the gonads may contribute to this phenomenon as desert - but not urban - towhees had a marked plasma testosterone response to GnRH challenge. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, such studies typically assume that phylogenetic branches of equivalent length are more or less interchangeable. Here we suggest that there is a need to consider not only branch lengths but also their placement on the phylogeny. We demonstrate how two common indices of network centrality can be used to describe the evolutionary distinctiveness of network elements (nodes and branches) on a phylogeny. If phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem function via complementarity and the representation of functional diversity, we would predict a correlation between evolutionary distinctiveness of network elements and their contribution to ecosystem process. In contrast, if one or a few evolutionary innovations play key roles in ecosystem function, the relationship between evolutionary distinctiveness and functional contribution may be weak or absent. We illustrate how network elements associated with high functional contribution can be identified from regressions between phylogenetic diversity and productivity using a well-known empirical data set on plant productivity from the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research. We find no association between evolutionary distinctiveness and ecosystem functioning, but we are able to identify phylogenetic elements associated with species of known high functional contribution within the Fabaceae. Our perspective provides a useful guide in the search for ecological traits linking diversity and ecosystem function, and suggests a more nuanced consideration of phylogenetic diversity is required in the conservation and biodiversity-ecosystem-function literature.},

	abstract = {Periphyton is a critical energy source for consumers in lakes of all sizes, but estimates of average, area-specific littoral zone benthic primary production (LBP) have been hampered by low spatial and temporal resolution of productivity data. We analyzed the sensitivity of estimates of LBP to depth-specific variation in photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) parameters and temporal variation in water clarity using monitoring data from five northern temperate lakes. Maximum photosynthesis rates peaked in the upper epilimnion in all five lakes, and our best daily estimates of LBP ranged from 125 mg C m(-2) d(-1) to 425 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Nonlinear variation in maximum photosynthesis (P-MAX) with depth caused overestimates in LBP by an average of 10\% when mean values of P-MAX were applied throughout the euphotic zone. Conversely, applying values of light levels at onset of saturation (E-k) from the upper epilimnion resulted in underestimating LBP by an average of 19\% compared with the most data-rich (optimal) calculations. Simplified approximations of bathymetry yielded underestimates or overestimates of LBP, depending on basin shape. Incorporating temporal variation in water clarity and daily solar irradiance did not substantially improve estimates of average summer LBP compared with estimates that incorporated summer average values of K-d, but this result should not be extrapolated to lakes with more variable water clarity. Estimates of average littoral zone benthic primary production can be optimized by incorporating depth-specific variation in maximum periphyton productivity, saturation light intensity, and sediment surface area into calculations.},

These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi- year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America.},

A key controversy in lake eutrophication science is the relative importance of controlling P and N in water quality management, and we are interested how the science of this controversy transfers to flowing waters. A literature review indicates (1) stream benthic chlorophyll is significantly correlated to both total N and total P in the water column, with both nutrients explaining more variance than either considered alone; (2) nutrients have increased substantially in many rivers and streams of the United States over reference conditions, and strong shifts in N and P stoichiometry have occurred as well; (3) bioassays often indicate N responses alone or in concert with P responses for autotrophic (primary production and chlorophyll) and heterotrophic (respiration) responses; (4) both heterotrophic and autotrophic processes are influenced by the availability of N and P; and (5) N-fixing cyanobacteria usually do not seem to be able to fully satisfy N limitations in rivers and streams when P is present in excess of N.

We compared P retention between two urban/suburban SCMs and their adjacent free-flowing stream reaches at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Study (LTER) site, and examined changes in P retention in SCMs across flow conditions. Results show that, when compared with free-flowing stream reaches, the SCMs had significantly lower dissolved oxygen (\%DO) and higher P concentrations, as well as lower mean areal retention rates and retention efficiencies of particulate P (PP). In all the SCMs, concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) consistently exhibited inverse correlations with \%DO that was lower during summer base flows. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations peaked during spring high flow period in both streams and in-line pond/SCMs, but they were also higher during summer base flows in suburban/urban SCMs. Meanwhile, PP areal retention rates and retention efficiencies of the SCMs changed from positive (indicating retention) during high flows to negative (indicating release) during low flows, while such changes across flow were not observed in free-flowing stream reaches. We attribute the changing roles of SCMs from a PP sink to a PP source to changes in SCM hydrologic mass balances, physical sedimentation and biogeochemical mobilization across flows. This study demonstrates that in suburban/urban SCMs, P retained during high flow events can be released during low flows. Cultivation of macrophytes and/or frequent sediment dredging may provide potential solutions to retaining both P and nitrogen in urban SCMs.},

As a vectorborne disease, rates of plague transmission may increase when fleas are abundant. Fleas are highly susceptible to desiccation under hot-dry conditions; we posited that their densities decline during droughts. We evaluated this hypothesis with black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in New Mexico, June-August 2010-2012. Precipitation was relatively plentiful during 2010 and 2012 but scarce during 2011, the driest spring-summer on record for the northeastern grasslands of New Mexico. Unexpectedly, fleas were 200\% more abundant in 2011 than in 2010 and 2012. Prairie dogs were in 27\% better condition during 2010 and 2012, and they devoted 287\% more time to grooming in 2012 than in 2011. During 2012, prairie dogs provided with supplemental food and water were in 23\% better condition and carried 40\% fewer fleas. Collectively, these results suggest that during dry years, prairie dogs are limited by food and water, and they exhibit weakened defenses against fleas. Long-term data are needed to evaluate the generality of whether droughts increase flea densities and how changes in flea abundance during sequences of dry and wet years might affect plague cycles in mammalian hosts.},

	abstract = {We tested for depth-dependent vertical zonation in coral reef community structure with surveys conducted in 2013 at 10 m and 27 m depth off the islands of Moorea, Tahiti, Maiao, and Tetiaroa, which are distributed over similar to 3500 km(2) of the tropical south Pacific. Benthic communities were censused using photoquadrats to obtain percentage cover, first by functional groups (scleractinians, macroalgae, and crustose coralline algae, algal turf, and bare space combined [CTB]), and second by genus for scleractinians and Millepora. Virtually every aspect of community structure differed between the two depths, but the effects were dependent on spatial scale of investigation. Interactive effects of islands and depths determined the abundance of functional groups, as well as seven of eight common coral genera. On the two islands at which two sites were censused, the abundance of functional groups also differed between sites, and was affected by depth x site interactions. The spatially variable effects of depth on community structure underscores the importance of context-specific synergy between biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns. Spatial scale-dependent vertical zonation also shows the potential for these effects to be modulated by the changes that have affected coral community structure on contemporary reefs over the last few decades.},

Reefs were surveyed in 2013 on Moorea, Tahiti, Tetiaroa, and Maiao, with community structure sampled at two sites on each island using photoquadrats. The effects of coral recruitment on population structure were evaluated through genetic analyses of Pocillopora on three of the islands. Benthic community structure with functional group resolution differed among islands and generally among sites, but coral community structure (generic resolution) differed among islands, but generally not among sites. Genetic analyses of Pocillopora using the open reading frame of host mtDNA revealed varying relative abundances of Pocillopora meandrina/Pocillopora eydouxi, Pocillopora verrucosa, Pocillopora effuses, and two unnamed haplotypes on each island. These results suggest that corals on each island represent unique samplings of genetically discrete larval assemblages rather than random samplings of a single larval assemblage. Together, our findings emphasize the extent to which coral community structure varies over a scale of {\textless} 200 km, and suggests that recruitment from spatially discrete pools of coral larvae plays an important role in creating spatial variation in community structure, even where reefs are connected by prevailing currents.},

	abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) are a powerful and popular approach to modeling population dynamics. Generalized linear models form the statistical backbone of an IPM. These models are typically fit using a frequentist approach. We suggest that hierarchical Bayesian statistical approaches offer important advantages over frequentist methods for building and interpreting IPMs, especially given the hierarchical nature of most demographic studies. Using a stochastic IPM for a desert cactus based on a 10-year study as a worked example, we highlight the application of a Bayesian approach for translating uncertainty in the vital rates (e.g., growth, survival, fertility) to uncertainty in population-level quantities derived from them (e.g., population growth rate). The best fit demographic model, which would have been difficult to fit under a frequentist framework, allowed for spatial and temporal variation in vital rates and correlated responses to temporal variation across vital rates. The corresponding posterior probability distribution for the stochastic population growth rate (lambda(S)) indicated that, if current vital rates continue, the study population will decline with nearly 100\% probability. Interestingly, less supported candidate models that did not include spatial variance and vital rate correlations gave similar estimates of lambda(S). This occurred because the best fitting model did a much better job of fitting vital rates to which the population growth rate was weakly sensitive. The cactus case study highlights several advantages of Bayesian approaches to IPM modeling, including that they: (1) provide a natural fit to demographic data, which are often collected in a hierarchical fashion (e.g., with random variance corresponding to temporal and spatial heterogeneity); (2) seamlessly combine multiple data sets or experiments; (3) readily incorporate covariance between vital rates; and, (4) easily integrate prior information, which may be particularly important for species of conservation concern where data availability may be limited. However, constructing a Bayesian IPM will often require the custom development of a statistical model tailored to the peculiarities of the sampling design and species considered; there may be circumstances under which simpler methods are adequate. Overall, Bayesian approaches provide a statistically sound way to get more information out of hard-won data, the goal of most demographic research endeavors.},

	abstract = {In mountainous areas such as the southern Appalachians USA, riparian zones are difficult to define. Vegetation is a commonly used riparian indicator and plays a key role in protecting water resources, but adequate knowledge of floristic responses to riparian disturbances is lacking. Our objective was to quantify changes in stand-level floristic diversity of riparian plant communities before (2004) and two, three, and seven years after shelterwood harvest using highlead cable-yarding and with differing no cut buffer widths of 0 m, 10 m, and 30 m distance from the stream edge. An unharvested reference stand was also studied for comparison. We examined: (1) differences among treatment sites using a mixed linear model with repeated measures; (2) multivariate relationships between ground-layer species composition and environmental variables (soil water content, light transmittance, tree basal area, shrub density, and distance from stream) using nonmetric multidimensional scaling; and (3) changes in species composition over time using a multi-response permutation procedure. We hypothesized that vegetation responses (i.e., changes in density, species composition, and diversity across the hillslope) will be greatest on harvest sites with an intermediate buffer width (10-m buffer) compared to more extreme (0-m buffer) and less extreme (30-m buffer and no-harvest reference) disturbance intensities. Harvesting initially reduced overstory density and basal area by 83\% and 65\%, respectively, in the 0-m buffer site; reduced by 50\% and 74\% in the 10-m buffer site; and reduced by 45\% and 29\% in the 30-m buffer site. Both the 0-m and 10-m buffer sites showed increased incident light variability across the hillslope after harvesting; whereas, there was no change in the 30-m and reference sites over time. We found significant changes in midstory and ground-layer vegetation in response to harvesting with the greatest responses on the 10-m buffer site, supporting our hypotheses that responses will be greatest on sites with intermediate disturbance. Ground-layer species composition differed significantly over time in the 0-m buffer and 10-m buffer sites (both P {\textless} 0.0001), but did not change in the 30-m buffer and reference sites (both P {\textgreater} 0.100). Average compositional dissimilarity increased after seven years, indicating greater within stand heterogeneity (species diversity) after harvesting. These vegetation recovery patterns provide useful information for evaluating management options in riparian zones in the southern Appalachians. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

In addition to these biogeophysical feedbacks, biogeochemical feedbacks associated with changes in carbon (C) storage in the vegetation and soils may also influence climate. Here, using a transient biogeographic model (ALFRESCO) and an ecosystem model (DOS-TEM), we quantified the biogeophysical feedbacks due to changes in vegetation and snow cover across continuous permafrost to non-permafrost ecosystems in Alaska and northwest Canada. We also computed the changes in carbon storage in this region to provide a general assessment of the direction of the biogeochemical feedback. We considered four ecoregions, or Landscape Conservations Cooperatives (LCCs; including the Arctic, North Pacific, Western Alaska, and Northwest Boreal). We examined the 90 year period from 2010 to 2099 using one future emission scenario (A1B), under outputs from two general circulation models (MPI-ECHAM5 and CCCMA-CGCM3.1). We found that changes in snow cover duration, including both the timing of snowmelt in the spring and snow return in the fall, provided the dominant positive biogeophysical feedback to climate across all LCCs, and was greater for the ECHAM(+ 3.1Wm(-2) decade(-1) regionally) compared to the CCCMA(+ 1.3Wm(-2) decade(-1) regionally) scenario due to an increase in loss of snow cover in the ECHAM scenario. The greatest overall negative feedback to climate from changes in vegetation cover was due to fire in spruce forests in the Northwest Boreal LCC and fire in shrub tundra in the Western LCC (-0.2 to-0.3Wm(-2) decade(-1)). With the larger positive feedbacks associated with reductions in snow cover compared to the smaller negative feedbacks associated with shifts in vegetation, the feedback to climate warming was positive (total feedback of + 2.7Wm(-2) decade regionally in the ECHAM scenario compared to + 0.76 Wm(-2) decade regionally in the CCCMA scenario). Overall, increases in C storage in the vegetation and soils across the study region would act as a negative feedback to climate. By exploring these feedbacks to climate, we can reach a more integrated understanding of the manner in which climate change may impact interactions between high-latitude ecosystems and the global climate system.},

We experimentally restored available calcium (Ca) to soils of a forested watershed at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, and measured the response of fine root biomass 14 years after treatment. In this northern hardwood forest, fine root ({\textless}1 mm diameter) biomass declined significantly in response to the Ca-addition treatment relative to pretreatment and reference forest conditions. The decline was greatest in the mid-and high-elevation hardwood zones of the watershed, where soils are thinnest and have the lowest base saturation and exchangeable Ca pools. Restoration of soil Ca appears to have reduced the allocation of carbon (C) to root systems, coincident with observed increases in aboveground biomass and productivity. Therefore, we suggest that relatively higher tree C allocation to roots in the past contributed to the depressed aboveground productivity observed in northern hardwood forest ecosystems impacted by acid deposition.},

The model simulates the coupled cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and their interactions with gross primary production (GPP). It was parameterized with field observations from an alpine dry meadow ecosystem using a global optimization strategy to estimate the unknown parameters. The model, along with the estimated parameters, was first validated against independent data and then used to examine the environmental controls over plant productivity. Our results show that air temperature is the strongest limiting factor to GPP in the early growing season, N availability becomes important during the middle portion of the growing season, and soil moisture is the strongest limiting factors by late in the growing season. Overall, the controls over GPP during the growing season, from strongest to weakest, are soil moisture content, air temperature, N availability, and P availability. This simulation provides testable predictions of the shifting nature of physical and nutrient limitations on plant growth. The model also indicates that changing environmental conditions in the alpine will likely lead to changes in productivity. For example, warming eliminates the control of P availability on GPP and makes N availability surpass air temperature to become the second strongest limiting factor. In contrast, an increase in atmospheric nutrient deposition eliminates the control of N availability and enhances the importance of P availability. These analyses provide a quantitative and conceptual framework that can be used to test predictions and refine ecological analyses at this long-term ecological research site.},

However, it is still unknown which environmental factors regulate the relative consumption of allochthonous resources in relation to autochthonous resources. Here, we evaluated the importance of allochthonous resources (litterfall) for the aquatic food webs in Neotropical tank bromeliads, a naturally replicated aquatic microcosm. Aquatic invertebrates were sampled in more than 100 bromeliads within either open or shaded habitats and within five geographically distinct sites located in four different countries. Using stable isotope analyses, we determined that allochthonous sources comprised 74\% (+/- 17\%) of the food resources of aquatic invertebrates. However, the allochthonous contribution to aquatic invertebrates strongly decreased from shaded to open habitats, as light incidence increased in the tanks. The density of detritus in the tanks had no impact on the importance of allochthonous sources to aquatic invertebrates. This overall pattern held for all invertebrates, irrespective of the taxonomic or functional group to which they belonged. We concluded that, over a broad geographic range, aquatic food webs of tank bromeliads are mostly allochthonous-based, but the relative importance of allochthonous subsidies decreases when light incidence favors autochthonous primary production. These results suggest that, for other freshwater systems, some of the between-study variation in the importance of allochthonous subsidies may similarly be driven by the relative availability of autochthonous resources.},

We test this in greenhouse mesocosms, experimentally manipulating each factor across three ecosystems: tallgrass prairie, alpine tundra and desert grassland. We found that resource limitation controlled productivity responses to N enrichment in all systems. Asymmetric competition was responsible for diversity declines in two systems. Plant community composition was impacted by both asymmetric competition and altered soil microbes, with some contributions from resource limitation. Results suggest there may be generality in the mechanisms of plant community change with N enrichment.

In particular, statistical analyses (i.e. analysis of variance, Tukey honest significant difference multiple comparison tests, nonparametric statistics and linear regression analysis) of 230 barrier island samples from Ocean City Inlet, Maryland, to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and 134 nearshore samples (d {\textless}= 10 m) identified grain-size trends related to the morphodynamic characteristics of these systems. In general, the Virginia barrier islands north of Wachapreague Inlet and Assateague Island form a statistically different subset of grain sizes (medium-grained to coarse-grained sand) from the islands south of Wachapreague Inlet (fine-grained sand). These textural trends corroborate the Pleistocene headlands of the Delmarva coastal compartment as the sediment source and indicate that some of the coarsegrained to medium-grained sediment bypasses the large sinks in the net southward longshore sediment transport system (i.e. Fishing Point and Chincoteague Inlet). This research also demonstrates that the preferential accumulation of coarse-grained to medium-grained sand on the ebb-tidal delta at Wachapreague Inlet probably controls the erosional morphodynamics of the islands located downdrift (south) of the inlet. These results suggest that an increase in tidal prism, set up by sea-level rise and/or a shift in wave climate/refraction patterns, may lead to barrier island fragmentation and a runaway transgression of this predominantly natural barrier island system. Consequently, a grain analysis of major coastal compartments, across multiple driving forces, can be used to assess coastal morphodynamics and the potential impact of climate change on coastal systems.},

Very little is known about the fate of these treated effluents in tropical streams. Short-term nutrient additions often are used to assess the fate of nutrients in streams, but long-term additions, such as those from sewage treatment plants, are likely to follow different uptake kinetics. Here we examined the longitudinal changes in Cl-,NO3--N, NH4+-N, dissolved organic N (DON), total dissolved N (TDN), soluble reactive P (SRP), and dissolved organic C (DOC) concentrations downstream from chronic WWTP inputs in 6 streams across the island of Puerto Rico. We applied the nutrient-uptake framework to these long-duration and high-magnitude nutrient additions to examine net nutrient uptake in these streams. On average, nutrient concentrations were increased more than 2x by sewage effluent at the study streams while DOC concentrations increased 30\%. Net nutrient uptake was sporadic, and on many dates, no evidence of measurable uptake was found. Biogeochemical processes, such as nitrification and remineralization, appeared to be responsible for some of the longitudinal increases in nutrient concentrations. Limited nutrient uptake and increasing nutrient concentrations along the reaches suggested that most of the time, nutrients were being transported downstream with no significant net retention. This result suggests that downstream transport of nutrients is large with the potential to create water-quality problems in downstream ecosystems. Our study highlighted the profound effects that inputs from point sources may have on stream chemistry and nutrient cycling in tropical receiving streams.},

We examined plant species composition and N availability along triplicate permafrost thaw gradients in Alaskan peatlands. Each gradient comprised four community types including: (i) a permafrost peatland with intact permafrost, (ii) a drunken forest experiencing active thaw, (iii) a moat representing initial complete thaw and (iv) a collapse scar bog representing several decades of post-thaw succession. Concentrations of dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic N (DIN) in the upper 60cm of soil increased along the permafrost thaw gradients. The drunken forest had the greatest mean concentrations of total dissolved N relative to the other community types, primarily due to greater concentrations of large molecular DON. The moat and collapse bog had significantly greater inorganic N concentrations than the permafrost or drunken forest, suggesting that changes in N availability are not a short-term effect, but can be sustained for decades or centuries. Across all plant community types, DIN and DON concentrations increased with soil depth during maximum seasonal ice thaw (September), suggesting that deeper soil horizons are important reservoirs of N post-thaw. Vegetation responses to permafrost thaw included changes in plant community composition shifting from upland forest species to hydrophilic vegetation with deeper rooting profiles in the collapse scar bogs and changes in foliar N and N-15 values. N concentrations in plant foliage and litterfall increased with concentrations of DIN during collapse bog succession, suggesting that plants are utilizing additional mineralized N.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the conversion of forest to wetlands associated with permafrost thaw in boreal lowlands increases N availability, at least in part by increasing turnover of deep soil organic matter. Plants appear to utilize these additional deeper N sources over timescales of years to centuries following permafrost thaw.},

	abstract = {Large volcanic eruptions can alter forest plant communities through a variety of mechanisms, including direct destruction of forests and changes to forest soils through tephra (aerially transported volcanic ejecta) deposits. While many studies have examined succession following direct destruction of forests, impacts to plant communities through tephra effects are less obvious, especially where the tephra depth is less than plant height. We used a 33-year experiment in an old growth forest that received shallow tephra deposition in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (WA, USA), to examine plant communities. We determined if community differences between plots with and without tephra: (1) were detectable, and (2) changed over time. We found that plant communities differed significantly between plots with and without tephra after 33 years. Further, differences were stronger after 33 years than at two years following the eruption. Species richness increased over time in both plots with and without tephra, but live cover was largely stable after two years. Nevertheless, communities shifted in different directions over time, where the changes in species composition and abundance immediately following tephra deposition were inconsistent with net changes that occurred over 30 years afterwards. These results suggest that widespread and apparently minor deposits of tephra, usually interpreted to be of transient importance if any, may induce long-term modifications of understory plant communities.

	abstract = {Ecosystem eutrophication often increases domination by non-natives and causes displacement of native taxa. However, variation in environmental conditions may affect the outcome of interactions between native and non-native taxa in environments where nutrient supply is elevated. We examined the interactive effects of eutrophication, climate variability and climate average conditions on the success of native and non-native plant species using experimental nutrient manipulations replicated at 32 grassland sites on four continents. We hypothesized that effects of nutrient addition would be greatest where climate was stable and benign, owing to reduced niche partitioning. We found that the abundance of non-native species increased with nutrient addition independent of climate; however, nutrient addition increased non-native species richness and decreased native species richness, with these effects dampened in warmer or wetter sites. Eutrophication also altered the time scale in which grassland invasion responded to climate, decreasing the importance of long-term climate and increasing that of annual climate. Thus, climatic conditions mediate the responses of native and non-native flora to nutrient enrichment. Our results suggest that the negative effect of nutrient addition on native abundance is decoupled from its effect on richness, and reduces the time scale of the links between climate and compositional change.},

This study focuses on an abiotic portion of the P cycle in the mangrove ecotone of Taylor Slough, coastal Everglades, Florida. We investigated the P sorption properties of sediment with three distinct water sources in this region: 1) fresh groundwater from the inland Everglades, 2) bicarbonate enriched groundwater from the mangrove ecotone, and 3) surface saltwater from Florida Bay. Soluble reactive P (SPR) in ecotone groundwater exhibit markedly low sorption efficiency (K-d = 0.2 L g(-1)) onto the sediment compared to fresh groundwater and Florida Bay water (11.3 L g(-1) and 3.4 L g(-1), respectively). The low SRP buffering capacity of the sediment in ecotone groundwater would maintain a higher ambient water SRP concentration in ecotone groundwater than in the other two waters. The relative sorption efficiency is consistent with the measured zero equilibrium SRP concentration being highest in ecotone groundwater (0.094 +/- 0.003 mu M) and lower in fresh groundwater and Florida Bay surface water (0.075 +/- 0.005 mu M and 0.058 +/- 0.004 mu M, respectively). The temporal variability of SRP concentration in groundwater at the ecotone field station is greater than the range of zero equilibrium SRP concentration for all three waters, so very low SRP concentration in the ambient water would induce desorption of P from the sediment. Such desorption processes would result in a higher ambient SRP concentration in ecotone groundwater than the other two water types. Our results suggest that ecotone groundwater, due to its higher bicarbonate content, would release more SRP from mangrove sediments compared to the upstream and downstream waters, as evidenced by both its lower P sorption efficiency and its higher zero equilibrium SRP concentration.

The yearly equilibrium line altitude is poorly correlated with mass balance because the elevation gradient of mass balance on each glacier can change dramatically from year to year. Most likely, winds redistribute the light snowfall disrupting the normal gradient of increasing mass balance with elevation. Reconstructed cumulative mass balance shows that the glaciers have lost {\textless}2 m w.e. over the past half century and area changes show minimal retreat. In most cases these changes are less than the uncertainty and the glaciers are considered in equilibrium. Since 2000, however, the glaciers have lost mass despite relatively stable summer air temperatures suggesting a different mechanism in play.

Using AFLP and methylation-sensitive AFLP, we tested the hypothesis that differentiation to habitats along natural salt marsh environmental gradients occurs at epigenetic, but not genetic loci in two salt marsh perennials. We detected significant genetic and epigenetic structure among populations and among subpopulations, but we found multilocus patterns of differentiation to habitat type only in epigenetic variation for both species. In addition, more epigenetic than genetic loci were correlated with habitat in both species. When we analysed genetic and epigenetic variation simultaneously with partial Mantel, we found no correlation between genetic variation and habitat and a significant correlation between epigenetic variation and habitat in Spartina alterniflora. In Borrichia frutescens, we found significant correlations between epigenetic and/or genetic variation and habitat in four of five populations when populations were analysed individually, but there was no significant correlation between genetic or epigenetic variation and habitat when analysed jointly across the five populations. These analyses suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the response to salt marsh habitats, but also that the relationships among genetic and epigenetic variation and habitat vary by species. Site-specific conditions may also cloud our ability to detect response in replicate populations with similar environmental gradients. Future studies analysing sequence data and the correlation between genetic variation and DNA methylation will be powerful to identify the contributions of genetic and epigenetic response to environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {Maize stover is beginning to be used as a cellulosic biofuel feedstock in the Midwestern United States; however, there are concerns that stover removal could result in increased soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter. Use of a winter cover crop following maize harvest has the potential to mitigate these impacts and may have additional benefits by providing continuous living cover in annual crop habitats leading to changes in insect predator communities and increased biocontrol services. However, cover crops may also be harvested in cellulosic biofuel systems, adding a disturbance event that may negatively affect biocontrol. We contrasted insect predator communities and their impacts in four potential bioenergy cropping systems in Michigan and Wisconsin (USA) during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. Two annual maize systems were harvested for grain and stover; one maize system included a cereal rye/Austrian winter pea cover crop. Two perennial systems, switchgrass and a mixed prairie grasses and forbs, were harvested in the fall for biomass. Predatory insect abundance and diversity were lower in both annual cropping systems than in the perennial cropping systems and the inclusion of the cover crop did not significantly alter these responses. Similarly, removal of sentinel insect egg prey was also lower in the annual versus perennial cropping systems, with no significant influence of cover crop. We also explored the potential for cover crops to harbor prey populations in the spring that might encourage oviposition by mobile predators and potentially lead to local population sources or sinks of predators depending on the timing and effect of cover crop harvest. We found that existing predator communities in the cover crop treatments effectively suppressed aphid population growth, limiting their attractiveness to mobile predators. While we found no significant positive or negative impacts of this cover crop system on biocontrol services, bioenergy cover cropping systems could be managed to increase multiple ecosystem services by altering cover crop identity, or timing of planting and harvest (C) 2016 The Authors.

Approximately 400 high-resolution cross-shelf sections of bio-optical properties collected with an oceanographic glider in the coastal Santa Barbara Channel, California, revealed complex relationships among optical properties and environmental conditions. Surface waves were found as a proximate control on suspended sediment variability for both inner and midshelves. Increases in phytoplankton abundances attributed to horizontal advection and upwelling events were observed only on episodic time scales. The lack of all-encompassing linear relationships between environmental forcings and changes in cross-shelf phytoplankton highlights the challenge of decoupling bio-optical signals from their controlling processes in coastal zones where phytoplankton distributions are patchy, and where nearshore and offshore phytoplankton populations and suspended sediments often occupy the same portion of the water column. Clear relationships between runoff and productivity were not observed. Temporal variability of suspended particles and phytoplankton distributions were roughly independent from each other during stratified conditions. Synchronous increases in phytoplankton and suspended sediments were observed when associated with strong upwelling events that may induce mixing and promote productivity. The repeated glider sections illustrated many processes regulating phytoplankton and particle transport in the innershelf and showed the difficulty in establishing general connections between high-frequency changes in optical properties and potential environmental forcings in a complex coastal environment.},

Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches. Location Western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to test the degree to which microclimate affects the distribution patterns of forest birds in a heterogeneous mountain environment. In all models we statistically accounted for vegetation structure, vegetation composition and potential biases due to imperfect detection of birds. We generated spatial predictions of forest bird distributions in relation to microclimate and vegetation structure. Results Fine-scale temperature metrics were strong predictors of bird distributions; effects of temperature on within-season occupancy dynamics were as large or larger (1-1.7 times) than vegetation effects. Most species (86.7\%) exhibited apparent within-season occupancy dynamics. However, species were almost as likely to be warm associated (i. e., apparent settlement at warmer sites and/or vacancy at cooler sites; 53.3\% of species) as cool associated (i. e., apparent settlement at cooler sites and/or vacancy at warmer sites; 46.7\% of species), suggesting that microclimate preferences are species specific. Main conclusions High-resolution temperature data increase the quality of predictions about avian distribution dynamics and should be included in efforts to project future distributions. We hypothesize that microclimate-associated distribution patterns may reflect species' potential for behavioural buffering from climate change in montane forest environments.},

For 20 years, we measured N2O fluxes in 11 ecosystems in southwest Michigan USA: four annual grain crops (corn-soybean-wheat rotations) managed with conventional, no-till, reduced input, or biologically based/organic inputs; three perennial crops (alfalfa, poplar, and conifers); and four unmanaged ecosystems of different successional age including mature forest. Average N2O emissions were higher from annual grain and N-fixing cropping systems than from nonleguminous perennial cropping systems and were low across unmanaged ecosystems. Among annual cropping systems full-rotation fluxes were indistinguishable from one another but rotation phase mattered. For example, those systems with cover crops and reduced fertilizer N emitted more N2O during the corn and soybean phases, but during the wheat phase fluxes were similar to 40\% lower. Likewise, no-till did not differ from conventional tillage over the entire rotation but reduced emissions similar to 20\% in the wheat phase and increased emissions 30-80\% in the corn and soybean phases. Greenhouse gas intensity for the annual crops (flux per unit yield) was lowest for soybeans produced under conventional management, while for the 11 other crop 9 management combinations intensities were similar to one another. Among the fertilized systems, emissions ranged from 0.30 to 1.33 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and were best predicted by IPCC Tier 1 and Delta EF emission factor approaches. Annual cumulative fluxes from perennial systems were best explained by soil NO3- pools (r(2) = 0.72) but not so for annual crops, where management differences overrode simple correlations. Daily soil N2O emissions were poorly predicted by any measured variables. Overall, long-term measurements reveal lower fluxes in nonlegume perennial vegetation and, for conservatively fertilized annual crops, the overriding influence of rotation phase on annual fluxes.},

	abstract = {A simplified soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum model of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure is developed and tested against observations from a drought-manipulation experiment in a woodland dominated by pinon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) in New Mexico. The number of model parameters is reduced using allometric relationships. The model can represent more isohydric (pinon) and more anisohydric (juniper) responses. Analysis of the parameter space suggests four main controls on hydraulic failure and carbon starvation: xylem vulnerability curve, root:shoot area ratio, rooting depth and water use efficiency. For pinon, an intermediate optimal (1.5-2 m(2) m(-2)) tree leaf area index reduces the risk of hydraulic failure. For both pinons and junipers, hydraulic failure was relatively insensitive to root:shoot ratio across a range of tree LAI. Higher root: shoot ratios however strongly decreased the time to carbon starvation. The hydraulic safety margin of pinons is strongly diminished by large diurnal variations in xylem/leaf water potential. Diurnal drops of water potential are mitigated by high maximum hydraulic conductivity, high root:shoot ratio and stomatal regulation (more isohydric). The safety margin of junipers is not very sensitive to diurnal drops in water potential so that there is little benefit in stomatal regulation (more anisohydric). Narrower tracheid diameter and a narrower distribution of tracheid diameters reduce the risk of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation by reducing diurnal xylem water potential drop. Simulated tree diameter-dependent mortality varies between these two species, with pinon mortality decreasing with increasing tree size, whereas juniper mortality increases with tree size. Juvenile pinons might thus be overimpacted by water stress. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Questions: How does fire severity, measured as depth of burn of ground layer fuels, control the regeneration of understorey species across black spruce-dominated stands varying in pre-fire organic layer depths? Are successional shifts from evergreen to deciduous understorey vegetation more likely to occur with greater depth of burn? Does a shift in understorey vegetation community towards more deciduous species influence carbon accumulation in vegetation biomass? Location: Northern boreal forest, interior Alaska. Methods: We sampled 32 stands in interior Alaska that burned in 2003 and 2004 in which depth of burn had been recorded soon after fire. In 2014 we characterized tree density, understorey vegetation composition, above-and below-ground vegetation carbon pools, and a suite of environmental variables. We used ANOVA and multivariate redundancy analysis models to analyse the dominant controls on vegetation composition and carbon pools. Results: Fire severity was a strong control on post-fire tree and non-vascular species composition. Ten years post-fire, sites that experienced deeper burning of organic layers had a higher abundance of deciduous tree species, fire-adapted mosses, forbs and graminoids, and lower abundances of evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Environmental variables (elevation, soil bulk density and mineral soil pH, moisture and temperature) served as important controls on tree and vascular understorey species composition. We found no evidence that carbon pools associated with recovering vegetation biomass were influenced by landscape position, fire severity or environmental variables. Conclusions: Both fire frequency and depth of burn are projected to increase with a warmer climate in interior Alaska. These shifts in fire regime are expected to favour the regeneration of deciduous species over conifers, which have the potential to regulate successional pathways and large-scale trends in albedo, which both ultimately could influence ecosystem-climate feedbacks and dampen future fire cycles. Our results show that understorey species composition is controlled by fire severity, suggesting that more severe burning causes a decline in the self-replacement of conifer communities across a range of hydrologic settings. Overall, our results suggest a loss of resilience in black spruce forests in the face of a changing fire regime. However, we found no evidence that fire severity influences vegetation carbon pools 10 yrs post-fire, suggesting that there is less landscape variation in biomass carbon pools than in vegetation composition and succession during early post-fire succession.},

	abstract = {Understanding the conditions that enable or constrain success in environmental governance is crucial for developing effective interventions and adapting approaches. Efforts to achieve and assess success in environmental quality improvement are often impeded by changes in conditions that drive outcomes but lie outside the scope of intervention and monitoring. We document how long-term changes in land use, agriculture, and climate act as non-stationary, shifting drivers of change that combine to render water quality management interventions less effective and increasingly difficult to assess. Focusing on the Yahara River watershed of south-central Wisconsin, USA, we ask how baselines influence program modeling, monitoring, and evaluation, as well as adaptation in governance approach. Through historical trend, GIS, and policy and qualitative data analyses, we find that changes in long-term land use and precipitation pattern dynamics exert tremendous pressure on water quality outcomes but are not captured in snapshot baseline assessments used in management planning or evaluation. Specifically, agricultural sector change related to the intensification of milk and manure production is increasingly challenging to address through best management practices, and flashier precipitation associated with climate change makes it difficult to achieve goals and establish a causal connection between management interventions and outcomes. Analysis of shifting drivers demonstrates challenges facing environmental governance in the context of climatic and social-ecological change. We suggest that goal setting, program design, and evaluation incorporate new modes of analysis that address slowly changing and external determinants of success.},

A field experiment in tallgrass prairie habitat was performed to examine the response in abundance and web-type richness of aerial web-building spiders to changes in the availability of structure for web placement (vegetation architecture). To test the hypothesis that vegetation structure contributes directly to the web-builder abundance and web-type richness in open grasslands, we increased vegetation structure by adding dead woody stems of a common shrub along transects in each of three watersheds that differed in burn histories and existing habitat structure. Aerial web-building spiders were visually censused before and after the manipulations, at which time we recorded web-orientation, height, web-type, and the presence/absence of the spider associated with a web. Over the duration of the study, a total of seven web-type groups were encountered, of which medium-sized orb weavers were the most abundant web-building group across all watersheds. In general, higher spider abundances of orb-building spiders were observed in sections with added structure compared to the non-manipulated sections. However, reduced richness of web types was found on the manipulated sections of transects, suggesting that the architecture provided by woody stems does not provide sufficient and appropriate web-anchoring structure for the full range of web-building spiders groups in tallgrass prairie.},

Macrofungi and trees were counted and identified in eight sites from 100 to 3500 m asl, and sequence data retrieved from GenBank for the same or closely related species were used to reconstruct their phylogenies. Patterns of species richness and phylogenetic diversity were similar for both macrofungi and trees, but macromycete richness and diversity peaked at mid-elevations, whereas woody plant richness and diversity did not show significant trends with elevation. Phylogenetic similarity among sites was low for both groups and decreased as elevational distance between sites increased. Macromycete communities displayed phylogenetic overdispersion at low elevations and phylogenetic clustering at high elevations; the latter is consistent with environmental filtering at high elevation sites. Woody plants generally exhibited phylogenetic clustering, consistent with the potential importance of environmental filtering throughout the elevational gradient.},

	abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP) and vegetation growth of the circumpolar north are changing in response to more pronounced warming in the region. We here introduce the first phenology index (PI) based vegetation dynamics product, comprising start (SOS), end (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and growing season integrated annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), specifically designed for the entire circumpolar north ({\textgreater}45 degrees N) using SPOT VGT data starting from 1999. PI combines the merits of NDVI and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) by taking the difference of squared greenness (from NDVI) and wetness (from NDII) to remove the soil and snow cover dynamics from key vegetation LSP cycles. The results show that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and their spatial distributions are realistically detected. Further validation based on North American and European deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf and mixed forests, and wetland flux tower sites shows good agreements between the LSP dates from the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and ground phenology estimates from CO2 flux measurements. The validation also proves that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics product is an improvement over the operational global MODIS Combined Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product for the circumpolar region. The results are further compared with the interannual variability of sea ice extent and leading teleconnection patterns in the region. The circumpolar averaged results show that, the growing season integrated annual NDVI is significantly increasing (0.68\% year(-1), p = 0.006) and well correlated with the growing season sea ice extent trend (p = 0.007). The circumpolar vegetation dynamics is more related to Polar/Eurasia pattern (i.e., indicator of circumpolar vortex) than to Scandinavian Pattern (SCA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In view of the considerable scientific and policy importance of the circumpolar region, particularly the arctic ecosystems, the presented circumpolar vegetation dynamics product will greatly contribute to study changes in plant growth, phenology, photosynthetic capacity, and associated feedbacks under climate change.

We sampled stream water along the impacted reach and compared concentrations of solutes to the long-term data from this stream (similar to 20 years of monitoring). Thermokarst-impacted stream water demonstrated higher electrical conductivity, and concentrations of chloride, sulfate, sodium, and nitrate than the long-term medians. These results suggest that this mode of lateral permafrost degradation may substantially impact stream solute loads and potentially fertilize stream and lake ecosystems. The potential for sediment to scour or bury stream algal mats is yet to be determined, though it may offset impacts of associated increased nutrient loads to streams.},

Bacterial mutualists in particular might evolve quickly, thanks to short generation times and the potential for independent evolution of plasmids through recombination and/or HGT (horizontal gene transfer). In a previous work using the legume/rhizobia mutualism, we demonstrated that long-term nitrogen fertilization caused the evolution of less-mutualistic rhizobia. Here, we use our 63 previously isolated rhizobium strains in comparative phylogenetic and quantitative genetic analyses to determine the degree to which variation in partner quality is attributable to phylogenetic relationships among strains versus recent genetic changes in response to N fertilization. We find evidence of distinct evolutionary relationships between chromosomal and pSym genes, and broad similarity between pSym genes. We also find that nifD has a unique evolutionary history that explains much of the variation in partner quality, and suggest MoFe subunit interaction sites in the evolution of less-mutualistic rhizobia. These results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the evolutionary response of rhizobia to long-term N fertilization, and we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of the mutualism.},

Decades of intensive study have yet to discern the actual mechanisms behind observed global patterns(2,3). Here, by integrating the predictions from multiple theories into a single model and using data from 1,126 grassland plots spanning five continents, we detect the clear signals of numerous underlying mechanisms linking productivity and richness. We find that an integrative model has substantially higher explanatory power than traditional bivariate analyses. In addition, the specific results unveil several surprising findings that conflict with classical models(4-7). These include the isolation of a strong and consistent enhancement of productivity by richness, an effect in striking contrast with superficial data patterns. Also revealed is a consistent importance of competition across the full range of productivity values, in direct conflict with some (but not all) proposed models. The promotion of local richness by macroecological gradients in climatic favourability, generally seen as a competing hypothesis(8), is also found to be important in our analysis. The results demonstrate that an integrative modelling approach leads to a major advance in our ability to discern the underlying processes operating in ecological systems.},

The church was discovered in the first year of a multi-year systematic archaeological siteless survey of the interfluve between the Garonne and Tarn River valleys in anticipation of its future development during construction of the Toulouse-to-Paris TGV train line. The Midi-Pyrenees Region containing the interfluve is archaeologically and historically rich, but lying between major and monumental archaeological sites in the region has not been subject to much systematic archaeological or historical investigation. The church remains were last recorded visible between 1576 and 1662 CE, and there is no record of its precise location, size or other characteristics. We summarize results of a ground penetrating radar survey and vertical sampling of sediment for an area ca. 2700 m(2) of floodplain under agriculture that combined with historical archive results indicates the church was in existence by at least 1100 CE. Proximity of the church remains to those of a third or fourth century Gallo-Roman villa are suggestive of a linkage between the two sites offering the possibility these sites can inform on the Medieval evolution of this landscape. The results also provide a cautionary note on negative results from archaeological surface surveys given the rate at which alluvium has accumulated in the interfluve. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We also evaluated the potential impacts of global climate change (GCC) on this species and predicted how directional environmental changes will affect dace. We sampled two 30m permanent sites in spring and autumn in the Coweeta catchment for rosyside dace density using three-pass electrofishing between 1984 and 1995, and a single 100 m site from 1991 to 2003. Habitat availability and flow variation data for this 20-year period demonstrated that two droughts (1985-1988 and 1999-2002) produced smaller wetted areas, lower mean, maximum and minimum flows, fewer high flow events and greater amounts of depositional substrata in the sites. Droughts produced significant increases in abundance, and significant decreases in standard length and mass of rosyside dace. Increases in abundance were mainly due to increased survival/immigration of young-of-the-year (YOY). Model selection analysis using multiple single and multivariable models indicated that density dependence in various forms possessed substantial explanatory power with respect to long-term variation in the per-capita rate of increase (r) in all sites and seasons. Density-dependent effects on r were stronger in autumn than spring, whereas negative density-independent models (flow variation) had the greatest explanatory power in spring. Results for growth data were similar to those for rosyside dace density and confirm density dependence likely through intraspecific competition for food or foraging sites leading to reduced growth at higher densities. These data support the hypothesis that species may persist in stochastic animal assemblages via strong intraspecific density dependence. Greater flow variability or increased high flows produced by GCC may destabilise this population leading to reduced compensation and possibly eventual extinction.},

	abstract = {Plant elemental composition can indicate resource limitation, and changes in key elemental ratios (e.g. plant C:N ratios) can influence rates including herbivory, nutrient recycling, and pathogen infection. Although plant stoichiometry can influence ecosystem-level processes, very few studies have addressed whether and how plant C:N stoichiometry changes with plant diversity and composition. Here, using two long-term experimental manipulations of plant diversity (Jena and Cedar Creek), we test whether plant richness (species and functional groups) or composition (functional group proportions) affects temporal trends and variability of community-wide C:N stoichiometry. Site fertility determined the initial community-scale C:N ratio. Communities growing on N-poor soil (Cedar Creek) began with higher C:N ratios than communities growing on N-rich soil (Jena). However, site-level plant C:N ratios converged through time, most rapidly in high diversity plots. In Jena, plant community C:N ratios increased. This temporal trend was stronger with increasing richness. However, temporal variability of C:N decreased as plant richness increased. In contrast, C:N decreased over time at Cedar Creek, most strongly at high species and functional richness, whereas the temporal variability of C:N increased with both measures of diversity at this site. Thus, temporal trends in the mean and variability of C:N were underlain by concordant changes among sites in functional group proportions. In particular, the convergence of community-scale C:N over time at these very different sites was mainly due to increasing proportions of forbs at both sites, replacing high mean C:N (C4 grasses, Cedar Creek) or low C:N (legumes, Jena) species. Diversity amplified this convergence; although temporal trends differed in sign between the sites, these trends increased in magnitude with increasing species richness. Our results suggest a predictive mechanistic link between trends in plant diversity and functional group composition and trends in the many ecosystem rates that depend on aboveground community C:N. Synthesis We compared the effect of plant diversity on the temporal dynamics of community stoichiometry in two long-term grassland diversity experiments: the Cedar Creek and Jena Experiments. Changes in community C:N ratios were accelerated by increasing diversity at both sites, but in opposite directions depending on soil fertility. Stoichiometry changes were driven by shifts of functional group composition differing in their elemental compositions, the identity of the functional groups depending on the site. Thus, we highlighted that community turnover constrained the effect of diversity on plant stoichiometry at both sites},

	abstract = {Recent advances in automation of photogrammetric 3D modelling software packages have stimulated interest in reconstructing highly accurate 3D object geometry in unconventional environments such as underwater utilizing simple and low-cost camera systems. The accuracy of underwater 3D modelling is affected by more parameters than in single media cases. This study is part of a larger project on 3D measurements of temporal change of coral cover in tropical waters. It compares the accuracies of 3D point clouds generated by using images acquired from a system camera mounted in an underwater housing and the popular GoPro cameras respectively. A precisely measured calibration frame was placed in the target scene in order to provide accurate control information and also quantify the errors of the modelling procedure. In addition, several objects (cinder blocks) with various shapes were arranged in the air and underwater and 3D point clouds were generated by automated image matching. These were further used to examine the relative accuracy of the point cloud generation by comparing the point clouds of the individual objects with the objects measured by the system camera in air (the best possible values). Given a working distance of about 1.5 m, the GoPro camera can achieve a relative accuracy of 1.3 mm in air and 2.0 mm in water. The system camera achieved an accuracy of 1.8 mm in water, which meets our requirements for coral measurement in this system.},

	abstract = {Iron (Fe) reduction and oxidation are important biogeochemical processes coupled to decomposition, nutrient cycling, and mineral weathering, but factors controlling their rates and spatial distribution with depth are poorly understood in terrestrial soils. In aquatic ecosystems, Fe reduction often occurs below a zone of oxic sediments. We tested an alternative conceptual model for Fe redox cycling in terrestrial soils using a deep humid tropical forest soil profile. We hypothesized that Fe reduction in anaerobic microsites scales with depth variation in labile C and Fe availability, as opposed to bulk oxygen (O-2). We measured bulk O-2 at multiple depths from 0.1 to 5 m quasi-continuously over 18 months and sampled soils from surface to bedrock (similar to 7 m). Median O-2 mixing ratios declined from 19.8 +/- 1.2 \% at 0.25 m to 16.1 +/- 1.0 \% at 1 m, but did not consistently decrease below 1 m, challenging a recent model of regolith development. Reduced Fe (Fe(II)) extractable in 0.5 M hydrochloric acid was greatest in 0-0.1 m soil and declined precipitously with depth, and did not correspond with visible gleying in B horizons. We observed similar depth trends in potential Fe reduction under anaerobic conditions. Depth trends in Fe(II) also closely mirrored short-term soil respiration and bulk soil C. Labile C stimulated Fe reduction at 0-0.1 m depth, whereas addition of short-range-ordered Fe oxides had no effect. Cultivable Fe-reducing bacterial abundance was four orders of magnitude greater in surface soil (0-0.1 m) than below 1 m. Although cultivable Fe oxidizing bacteria were typically also more abundant in surface soil, addition of labile C and nitrate stimulated Fe oxidizers in deep soil by two orders of magnitude under anaerobic conditions. This implies that infiltration of nitrate (and possibly C) from shallow soil water could potentially promote biotic Fe oxidation, a critical step in bedrock weathering, 7 m below. Together, these data suggest that C, Fe, and nutrient availability increase microbial Fe reduction and oxidation in surface (vs deeper) soil microsites despite high bulk O-2, in contrast to the depth segregation of electron accepting processes often observed in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the greatest capacity for Fe redox cycling can occur in A horizons that do not display gleying or mottling.},

	abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) is a well-documented pattern of warming in cities relative to rural areas. Most UHI research utilizes remote sensing methods at large scales, or climate sensors in single cities surrounded by standardized land cover. Relatively few studies have explored continental-scale climatic patterns within common urban microenvironments such as residential landscapes that may affect human comfort. We tested the urban homogenization hypothesis which states that structure and function in cities exhibit ecological "sameness" across diverse regions relative to the native ecosystems they replaced. We deployed portable micrometeorological sensors to compare air temperature and humidity in residential yards and native landscapes across six U.S. cities that span a range of climates (Phoenix, AZ; Los Angeles, CA; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Boston, MA; Baltimore, MD; and Miami, FL). Microclimate in residential ecosystems was more similar among cities than among native ecosystems, particularly during the calm morning hours. Maximum regional actual evapotranspiration (AET) was related to the morning residential microclimate effect. Residential yards in cities with maximum AET {\textless} 50-65 cm/year (Phoenix and Los Angeles) were generally cooler and more humid than nearby native shrublands during summer mornings, while yards in cities above this threshold were generally warmer (Baltimore and Miami) and drier (Miami) than native forests. On average, temperature and absolute humidity were similar to 6 \% less variable among residential ecosystems than among native ecosystems from diverse regions. These data suggest that common residential land cover and structural characteristics lead to microclimatic convergence across diverse regions at the continental scale.},

Associations with iron (Fe) oxides have been proposed to specifically protect lignin from decomposition, but impacts of Fe-lignin interactions on mineralization rates remain unclear. Oxygen (O-2) fluctuations characteristic of humid tropical soils drive reductive Fe dissolution and precipitation, facilitating multiple types of Fe-lignin interactions that could variably decompose or protect lignin. We tested impacts of Fe addition on C-13 methoxyl-labeled lignin mineralization in soils that were exposed to static or fluctuating O-2. Iron addition suppressed lignin mineralization to 21\% of controls, regardless of O-2 availability. However, Fe addition had no effect on soil CO2 production, implying that Fe oxides specifically protected lignin methoxyls but not bulk SOM. Iron oxide-lignin interactions represent a specific mechanism for lignin stabilization, linking SOM biochemical composition to turnover via geochemistry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Fire is a fundamental reorganizing force in chaparral and other Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Postfire nutrient redistribution and cycling are frequently invoked as drivers of ecosystem recovery. The extent to which N is transported from slopes to streams following fire is a function of the balance between the rate at which soil microbes retain and metabolize N into forms that readily dissolve or leach, and how rapidly recovering plants sequester this mobilized N. To better understand how fire impacts this balance, we sampled soil and plant N dynamics in 17 plots distributed across two burned, chaparral-dominated watersheds in Santa Barbara County, California. We measured a variety of ecosystem properties in both burned and unburned plots on a periodic basis for 2 years, including soil water content, pH, soil and plant carbon and nitrogen, extractable inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, and microbial biomass. In burned plots, nitrification was significantly enhanced relative to rates measured in unburned plots. Ephemeral herbs established quickly following the first postfire rain events. Aboveground plant biomass assimilated N commensurate with soil net mineralization, implying tight N cycling during the early stages of recovery. Microbial biomass N, on the other hand, remained low throughout the study. These findings highlight the importance of herbaceous species in conserving ecosystem nutrients as shrubs gradually recover.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean-type ecosystems are structured by fire. In California chaparral, fires uncouple inorganic nitrogen (N) production and consumption by enhancing nitrification and reducing plant uptake. Nitrate (NO3-) that accumulates after fire is vulnerable to leaching. However, the controls over N metabolism can change as chaparral ecosystems recover from fire, and these mechanisms are not well understood. To evaluate how ammonium (NH4+) availability, pH, and char influence N cycling, we measured inorganic N concentration and microbial biomass in chaparral soils that burned 1.5, 4, 23, and 49 years prior to sampling. We then experimentally adjusted NH4+ concentration, pH, and char content for all soils in a factorial design, and incubated them for 8 weeks. Each week, we measured respiration, exchangeable NH4+ and NO3- content, nitrification potential, microbial biomass, and pH. Within each watershed, NO3- was higher in soils collected from recently burned sites, than in soils from neighboring mature sites. Also, NO3- concentrations increased over the course of incubation in soils from all sites, especially with the addition of NH4+. When NH4+ was sufficiently high, pH determined the relative proportion of inorganic N that was nitrified. Char did not have a strong impact on N cycling, but in soils from 23- and 49-year-old sites, char treatments reduced the decline of microbial biomass C and N relative to control and fertilized treatments, perhaps by supplying C to soil microbes. These findings suggest that under some circumstances char may decelerate N cycling if it promotes immobilization and limits NH4+ supply to nitrifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we show how rank Storage Selection (rSAS) functions can be used to extract process-agnostic information from tracer breakthrough curves about the time-varying turnover of reach storage. A sequence of seven slug injections was introduced to a small stream at base flow over the course of a diel fluctuation in stream discharge, providing breakthrough curves at discharges ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 L/s. Shifted gamma distributions, each with three parameters varying stepwise in time, were used to model the rSAS function and calibrated to reproduce each breakthrough curve with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies in excess of 0.99. Variations in the fitted parameters over time suggested that storage within the reach does not uniformly increase its turnover rate when discharge increases. Rather, changes in transit time are driven by both changes in the average rate of turnover (external variability) and changes in the relative rate that younger and older water contribute to discharge (internal variability). Specifically, at higher discharge, the turnover rate increased for the youngest part of the storage (corresponding to approximately 5 times the volume of the channel), while discharge from the older part of the storage remained steady, or declined slightly. The method is shown to be extensible as a new approach to modeling reach-scale solute transport that accounts for the time-varying, discharge-dependent turnover of reach storage.},

Because plant species compete for the same set of limiting resources, theory predicts that addition of a limiting resource eliminates potential trade-offs, reducing the number of species that can coexist(2). Multiple nutrient limitation of plant production is common and therefore fertilization may reduce diversity by reducing the number or dimensionality of belowground limiting factors. At the same time, nutrient addition, by increasing biomass, should ultimately shift competition from belowground nutrients towards a one-dimensional competitive trade-off for light(3). Here we show that plant species diversity decreased when a greater number of limiting nutrients were added across 45 grassland sites from a multi-continent experimental network(4). The number of added nutrients predicted diversity loss, even after controlling for effects of plant biomass, and even where biomass production was not nutrient-limited. We found that elevated resource supply reduced niche dimensionality and diversity and increased both productivity(5) and compositional turnover. Our results point to the importance of understanding dimensionality in ecological systems that are undergoing diversity loss in response to multiple global change factors.},

In order to understand better their response to changing environment, we made observations and carried out a manipulation experiment to determine their response to variations in irradiance in Lake Hoare (77 degrees 38' S, 162 degrees 53' E). 2. Ice transparency was the most variable parameter that affected benthic light dose, both spatially and between years. Patterns of lamina accrual corresponded to irradiance history, with laminae that were initiated in high transmission years thicker than those from low transmission years. 3. A shading experiment confirmed that accrual of lamina thickness, calcite precipitation and ash-free dry mass were determined by irradiance, but photosynthetic biomass and phototrophic species composition were less affected. 4. Buried laminae decomposed only slowly over time, with potentially viable phototrophs many laminae down into the microbial mat. Decay rate increased only slightly with shading. 5. We conclude that the microbial mats in Lake Hoare are characterised by remarkable stability, with slow accumulation rates and turnover of biomass over time. Photosynthetic biomass and species composition appeared to be stable across long time periods, with interannual variation in lamination pattern due to differential accumulation of extracellular polysaccharide and representing the visible expression of annual growth conditions.},

	abstract = {Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) is an herbivore that ranges from desert grasslands to high-montane meadows and is limited by disease across much of its range. The importance of abiotic drivers to the population dynamics of the species is poorly known. We employed stable isotope analysis to investigate energy assimilation patterns as indicators of abiotic limitation in arid grassland and montane populations of C. gunnisoni during a multi-year drought. Standard ellipse areas of plasma and red blood cell carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values, representing population-level foraging niche widths, declined during years and seasons of drought stress at both study sites. Prairie dogs at the montane site, but not at the desert grassland site, maintained seasonal shifts in dietary niche width corresponding to periods of favorable growth conditions for the more nutritious C-3 plants. Production of offspring was strongly and positively correlated with C-3 resource use as indicated by delta C-13 values in metabolically active tissues (plasma and red blood cells), but not with delta C-13 values in adipose tissues used for long-term energy storage, or with foraging niche widths. These findings demonstrate that assimilation of energy from C-3 plants is associated with increased reproductive output and that drought conditions importantly constrain the resource base available to C. gunnisoni. The link between plant nutritional quality and demographic parameters highlights the role of abiotic regulation within this reportedly disease-limited species.},

A difference of as much as 3.6 and 130 aEuro degrees in their delta C-13 and delta D values was observed between the two most abundant emergent macrophyte species (Cladium and Eleocharis), respectively. A clear n-alkane delta D value depletion (-130 to -167 aEuro degrees) and decreasing Paq was observed along the slough-to-ridge soil transect, likely the result of an eco-hydrological transition from slough-to-ridge dominated vegetation (Eleocharis to Cladium). In agreement with the relatively constant Paq values, the lack of significant changes in the delta D depth profile for the slough core, suggest a consistent slough type of vegetation composition over time at that location. In contrast, changes of both n-alkane delta C-13 and delta D values for the ridge core, especially after similar to 1960 AD, coincide with the expected plant successions from historically long hydroperiod ({\textgreater} 8 months), slough type plants (Eleocharis, Utricularia, Nymphaea) to present day, shorter hydroperiod ({\textless} 8 months), ridge type plants (Cladium). These delta C-13 and delta D changes seem to be driven by vegetation shifts associated with hydrological change. The application of the compound-specific stable isotope determinations may strongly complement the biomarker approach for paleo-hydrological assessments in wetland ecosystems.},

These compounds were present in varying amounts up to 54.1, 1.0 and 3.4 mu g g(-1) dry weight in the leaves, bark and the crustose lichens attached to the bark of A. germinans respectively. These MMAs were not detected in the leaf waxes of Rhizophora mangle and Laguncularia racemosa, but were detected in significantly lower abundances (2- 6\% of that in A. germinans leaf wax) in the bark and lichen of R. mangle. Significant odd- carbon number distributions and even-carbon number distributions were observed for long chain (C {\textgreater}= 25) iso(maximising at C-31) and anteiso-MMAs (maximising at C-32) respectively in A. germinans leaf wax. However, no obvious carbon number preferences were detected for bark and lichen. The long chain (LC) iso- and anteiso-MMAs in A. germinans leaf waxes were found to be enriched in C-13 by 0.3- 4.3 and 0.7-4.2 per mille (\%) compared to the n- alkanes with the same carbon numbers respectively across the salinity gradient of 19.7-32.0 practical salinity units (psu). In comparison, the LC iso- and anteiso-MMAs were found to be more depleted in D by 6.1-55.1 and 7.3-57.0\% compared to the n-alkanes with same carbon numbers respectively. The results imply that A. germinans could be another important source of iso- and anteiso-alkanes in sediments and soils, and that these compounds could potentially be used as biomarkers for this species in mixed mangrove environments.},

One diene and one triene were observed more frequently than the others. The HBIs were present in varying amount of up to 1000, 19,000, 780 and 150 ng/g dry weight in the periphyton, floc, surface soils and deeper soils (ca. 1900 AD), respectively. Compound specific carbon isotope analysis of the two most dominant HBIs (one diene and one triene) showed them to be highly depleted in C-13 (delta C-13 -40.0\% to -38.5\%) in freshwater floc, suggesting recycled CO2 produced from the decomposition of organic matter as an important C source in the biosynthesis of these compounds. HBIs were present across this freshwater wetland in greater diversity and abundance at locations with higher surface water N concentration and longer hydroperiod (inundation). Historical variation in the occurrence of the HBIs in soil cores from multiple slough and ridge environments was assessed. Their increased abundance after ca. 1960 AD in almost all cores suggests proliferation of their precursor biota (freshwater diatoms) over the past five decades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {As a result of uncertain resource availability and growing populations, city managers are implementing conservation plans that aim to provide services for people while reducing household resource use. For example, in the US, municipalities are incentivizing homeowners to replace their water-intensive turfgrass lawns with water-efficient landscapes consisting of interspersed drought-tolerant shrubs and trees with rock or mulch groundcover (e.g. xeriscapes, rain gardens, water-wise landscapes). While these strategies are likely to reduce water demand, the consequences for other ecosystem services are unclear. Previous studies in controlled, experimental landscapes have shown that conversion from turfgrass to shrubs may lead to high rates of nutrient leaching from soils. However, little is known about the long-term biogeochemical consequences of this increasingly common land cover change across diverse homeowner management practices. We explored the fate of soil nitrogen (N) across a chronosequence of land cover change from turfgrass to water-efficient landscapes in privately owned yards in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, in the arid US Southwest. Soil nitrate (NO3--N) pools were four times larger inwater-efficient landscapes (25 +/- 4 kg NO3--N/ha; 0-45 cmdepth) compared to turfgrass lawns (6 +/- 7 kg NO3--N/ ha). Soil NO3--N also varied significantly with time since landscape conversion; the largest pools occurred at 9-13 years after turfgrass removal and declined to levels comparable to turfgrass thereafter. Variation in soil NO3--N with landscape age was strongly influenced bymanagement practices related to soil water availability, including shrub cover, sub-surface plastic sheeting, and irrigation frequency. Our findings show that transitioning from turfgrass to water-efficient residential landscaping can lead to an accumulation of NO3--N that may be lost from the plant rooting zone over time following irrigation or rainfall. These results have implications for best management practices to optimize the benefits of water-conserving landscapes while protecting water quality.},

	abstract = {The timing of events in the life history of temperate insects is most typically primarily cued by one of two drivers: photoperiod or temperature accumulation over the growing season. However, an insect's phenology can also be moderated by other drivers like rainfall or the phenology of its host plants. When multiple drivers of phenology interact, there is greater potential for phenological asynchronies to arise between an organism and those with which it interacts. We examined the phenological patterns of a highly seasonal group of fireflies (Photinus spp., predominantly P. pyralis) over a 12-year period (2004-2015) across 10 plant communities to determine whether interacting drivers could explain the variability observed in the adult flight activity density (i.e. mating season) of this species. We found that temperature accumulation was the primary driver of phenology, with activity peaks usually occurring at a temperature accumulation of approximately 800 degree days (base 10 degrees C); however, our model found this peak varied by nearly 180 degree-day units among years. This variation could be explained by a quadratic relationship with the accumulation of precipitation in the growing season; in years with either high or low precipitation extremes at our study site, flight activity was delayed. More fireflies were captured in general in herbaceous plant communities with minimal soil disturbance (alfalfa and no-till field crop rotations), but only weak interactions occurred between within-season responses to climatic variables and plant community. The interaction we observed between temperature and precipitation accumulation suggests that, although climate warming has the potential to disrupt phenology of many organisms, changes to regional precipitation patterns can magnify these disruptions.},

	abstract = {Wetlands provide quintessential ecosystem services such as maintenance of water quality, water supply and biodiversity, among others; however, wetlands are also among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an abundant and critical component in wetland biogeochemistry. This study describes the first detailed, comparative, molecular characterization of DOM in subtropical, pulsed, wetlands, namely the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Okavango Delta (Botswana), using optical properties, high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), and compares compositional features to variations in organic matter sources and flooding characteristics (i.e., differences in hydroperiod). While optical properties showed a high degree of variability within and between the three wetlands, analogies in DOM fluorescence properties were such that an established excitation emission matrix fluorescence parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) model for the Everglades was perfectly applicable to the other two wetlands. Area-normalized H-1 NMR spectra of selected samples revealed clear distinctions of samples while a pronounced congruence within the three pairs of wetland DOM readily suggested the presence of an individual wetland-specific molecular signature. Within sample pairs (long-vs. short-hydroperiod sites), internal differences mainly referred to intensity variations (denoting variable abundance) rather than to alterations of NMR resonances positioning (denoting diversity of molecules). The relative disparity was largest between the Everglades long- and short-hydroperiod samples, whereas Pantanal and Okavango samples were more alike among themselves. Otherwise, molecular divergence was most obvious in the case of unsaturated protons (delta(H) {\textgreater} 5 ppm). 2-D NMR spectroscopy for a particular sample revealed a large richness of aliphatic and unsaturated substructures, likely derived from microbial sources such as periphyton in the Everglades. In contrast, the chemical diversity of aromatic wetland DOM likely originates from a combination of higher plant sources, progressive microbial and photochemical oxidation, and contributions from combustion-derived products (e.g., black carbon). FT-ICRMS spectra of both Okavango and Pantanal showed near 57 +/- 2\% CHO, 8 +/- 2\% CHOS, 33 +/- 2\% CHNO and {\textless}1\% CHNOS molecules, whereas those of Everglades samples were markedly enriched in CHOS and CHNOS at the expense of CHO and CHNO compounds. In particular, the Everglades short-hydroperiod site showed a large set of aromatic and oxygen-deficient "black sulfur" compounds whereas the long-hydroperiod site contained oxygenated sulfur attached to fused-ring polyphenols. The elevated abundance of CHOS compounds for the Everglades samples likely results from higher inputs of agriculture-derived and sea-spray-derived sulfate. Although wetland DOM samples were found to share many molecular features, each sample was unique in its composition, which reflected specific environmental drivers and/or specific biogeochemical processes.},

Changes of C-13/C and N-15/N in soils, earthworms, and microbial populations were analyzed to evaluate resource utilization by earthworms and their influences on C and N dynamics. Estherella spp. utilized the C-13-labeled litter; however, its utilization on the C-13-labeled litter reduced when cultivated with P. corethrurus and O. borincana. Both P. corethrurus and O. borincana utilized the C-13-labeled litter and C-15-labeled grass roots and root exudates. Pontoscolex corethrurus facilitated soil respiration by stimulating C-13-labeled microbial activity; however, this effect was suppressed possibly due to the changes in the microbial activities or community when coexisting with O. borincana. Increased soil N mineralization by individual Estherella spp. and O. borincana was reduced in the mixed-species treatments. The rapid population growth of P. corethrurus may increase competition pressure on food resources on the local earthworm community. The relevance of resource availability to the population growth of P. corethrurus and its significance as an invasive species is a topic in need of future research.},

This received great academic attention because of potential ecological, social and health impacts.

Our study aims to answer two questions: (1) Do social conditions influence temperature independent of land cover? (2) Is land cover more closely associated with temperature than neighborhood social conditions or vice versa? The analysis is for the year 2000 and the Gwynns Falls watershed in Baltimore, Maryland. Census data for 297 block groups and remote sensed data for land cover and surface temperature were used. To answer question 1, we used structural equation modeling to build and compare model fitness. We conducted partial correlation and regression analysis to answer question 2. Land cover (building and trees) leads both social conditions (race and income) and temperature to vary across space. When holding land cover constant, social conditions significantly contribute to temperature variation. This study extends understanding beyond simple correlation and determined that land cover influences the spatial variation in neighborhood social conditions and temperature.},

Future climate change is therefore expected to influence grassland phenology and growth, with consequences for ecosystems and economies. However, the interacting effects of major shifts in temperature and precipitation on grasslands remain poorly understood and existing modelling approaches, although typically complex, do not extrapolate or generalize well and tend to disagree under future scenarios(3,4). Here we explore the potential responses of North American grasslands to climate change using a new, data-informed vegetation-hydrological model, a network of high-frequency ground observations across a wide range of grassland ecosystems and CMIP5 climate projections. Our results suggest widespread and consistent increases in vegetation fractional cover for the current range of grassland ecosystems throughout most of North America, despite the increase in aridity projected across most of our study area. Our analysis indicates a likely future shift of vegetation growth towards both earlier spring emergence and delayed autumn senescence, which would compensate for drought-induced reductions in summer fractional cover and productivity. However, because our model does not include the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis and water use efficiency(5,6), climate change impacts on grassland productivity may be even larger than our results suggest. Increases in the productivity of North American grasslands over this coming century have implications for agriculture, carbon cycling and vegetation feedbacks to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Although the influence of nitrogen (N) addition on grassland plant communities has been widely studied, it is still unclear whether observed patterns and underlying mechanisms are constant across biomes. In this systematic review, we use meta-analysis and metaregression to investigate the influence of N addition (here referring mostly to fertilization) upon the biodiversity of temperate mountain grasslands (including montane, subalpine and alpine zones). Forty-two studies met our criteria of inclusion, resulting in 134 measures of effect size. The main general responses of mountain grasslands to N addition were increases in phytomass and reductions in plant species richness, as observed in lowland grasslands. More specifically, the analysis reveals that negative effects on species richness were exacerbated by dose (ha(-1)year(-1)) and duration of N application (years) in an additive manner. Thus, sustained application of low to moderate levels of N over time had effects similar to short-term application of high N doses. The climatic context also played an important role: the overall effects of N addition on plant species richness and diversity (Shannon index) were less pronounced in mountain grasslands experiencing cool rather than warm summers. Furthermore, the relative negative effect of N addition on species richness was more pronounced in managed communities and was strongly negatively related to N-induced increases in phytomass, that is the greater the phytomass response to N addition, the greater the decline in richness. Altogether, this review not only establishes that plant biodiversity of mountain grasslands is negatively affected by N addition, but also demonstrates that several local management and abiotic factors interact with N addition to drive plant community changes. This synthesis yields essential information for a more sustainable management of mountain grasslands, emphasizing the importance of preserving and restoring grasslands with both low agricultural N application and limited exposure to N atmospheric deposition.},

	abstract = {Allometry, the proportional scaling of log trait size with log body size, evolves to optimize allocation to growth of separate structures and is a major constraint on the functional limits of animal traits. While there are many studies demonstrating the rigidity of allometry across traits and taxa, comparatively less work has been done on allometric variation across environments within species. Rapidly changing environments, such as cities, may be prime systems for studying the flexibility of allometry because they uniquely alter many environmental parameters (e.g., habitat, light, noise). We studied size variation, allometry, and allometric dispersion of craniofacial traits in both sexes of urban and rural house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) because many traits in the head are ecologically critical to the survival and acclimation of birds to their environment (e. g., brain: response to cognitive challenges; bill: foraging modes). We found that urban finches had shorter eye axial lengths and skull widths, but longer (but not wider or deeper) bills, than rural finches. Also, allometric slopes of eye, skull, and bill traits differed based on sex and environment. In the rural environment, females had a far steeper allometric slope for eye axial length than males, but such slopes were similar between males and females in the city. Skull allometry was similar for males and females in both environments, but urban birds had a shallower slope for skull length (but not width) than rural birds. Other traits only differed by sex (males had a steeper slope for bill width), and one trait did not differ based on either sex or environment (bill depth). The dispersion of points around the allometric line did not differ by sex or environment for any craniofacial variable. Due to the significant but low genetic divergence between urban and rural finch populations, allometric differences are probably largely driven by plastic forces. We suggest that differences in diet and cognitive demand of urban environments may drive these allometric patterns. Overall, these results indicate that allometry may shift due to rapid environmental change and differentially so between the sexes.},

	abstract = {Many organisms exhibit depressed metabolism when resources are limited, a change that makes it possible to balance an energy budget. For symbiotic reef corals, daily cycles of light and periods of intense cloud cover can be chronic causes of food limitation through reduced photosynthesis. Furthermore, coral bleaching is common in present-day reefs, creating a context in which metabolic depression could have beneficial value to corals. In the present study, corals (massive Porites spp.) were exposed to an extreme case of resource limitation by starving them of food and light for 20 days. When resources were limited, the corals depressed area-normalized respiration to 37\% of initial rates, and coral biomass declined to 64\% of initial amounts, yet the corals continued to produce skeletal mass. However, the declines in biomass cannot account for the declines in area-normalized respiration, as mass-specific respiration declined to 30\% of the first recorded time point. Thus, these corals appear to be capable of metabolic depression. It is possible that some coral species are better able to depress metabolic rates than others; such variation could explain differential survival during conditions that limit resources (e.g. shading). Furthermore, we found that maintenance of existing biomass, in part, supports the production of skeletal mass. This association could be explained if maintenance supplies needed energy (e.g. ATP) or inorganic carbon (i.e. CO2) that otherwise limits the production of skeletal mass. Finally, the observed metabolic depression can be explained as a change in pool sizes, and does not require a change in metabolic rules.},

This species is a relative of wheat undergoing domestication. An additional experiment compared photosynthetic rates in different cohorts at mid-season and under colder conditions. We hypothesized that photosynthetic capacity in older plants would be lower under favorable conditions but higher under cold stress. Our hypothesis was generally supported. Under cold stress, 5-year-old plants exhibited higher A, TPU, and temperature-adjusted V (Cmax) than younger plants, as well as 50\% more SPS and 37\% more Rubisco. In contrast, at mid-season, photosynthetic capacities in older plants were lower than in younger plants in one experiment, and similar in the other, independent of differences in water status. Both cohorts increased A, temperature-adjusted TPU and J (max), [Rubisco], and [SPS] under cold stress, but changes were greater in older plants. Photosynthetic differences were largest at 1.2 A(0)C in very early spring, where older plants had 200\% higher A and maintained up to 17\% of their peak photosynthetic capacity. We find evidence of increased cold tolerance in older cohorts of wheatgrass, consistent with a growing body of research in woody perennials.},

	abstract = {Old growth mangroves in existing protected areas store more carbon than restored forests or plantations. Carbon storage in such forests has economic value independent of additionality, offering opportunities for policy makers to ensure their maintenance, and inclusion in climate change mitigation strategies. Mangrove forests of the Everglades National Park (ENP), South Florida, though protected, face external stressors such as hydrological alterations because of flooding control structures and agriculture impacts and saltwater intrusion as a result of increasing sea level rise. Moreover, decreased funding of Everglades' restoration activities following the recent economic crisis (beginning 2008) threatens the restoration of the Greater Everglades including mangrove dominated coastal regions. We evaluate several economic and ecological challenges confronting the economic valuation of total (vegetation plus soil) organic carbon (TOC) storage in the ENP mangroves. Estimated TOC storage for this forested wetland ranges from 70 to 537 Mg C/ha and is higher than values reported for tropical, boreal, and temperate forests. We calculate the average abatement cost of C specific for ENP mangroves to value the TOC from \$2-\$3.4 billion; estimated unit area values are \$13,859/ha-\$23,728/ha. The valuation of the stored/legacy carbon is based on the: 1) ecogeomorphic attributes, 2) regional socio-economic milieu, and 3) status of the ENP mangroves as a protected area. The assessment of C storage estimates and its economic value can change public perception about how this regulating ecosystem service of ENP mangrove wetlands (144,447 ha) supports human well-being and numerous economic activities. This perception, in turn, can contribute to future policy changes such that the ENP mangroves, the largest mangrove area in the continental USA, can be included as a potential alternative in climate change mitigation strategies.

A growing body of work suggests that hydrologically restoring streams and rivers in agricultural and urban watersheds has potential to increase N and P retention, but rates and mechanisms have not yet been analyzed and compared across studies. We conducted a review of nutrient retention within hydrologically reconnected streams and rivers, including 79 studies. We developed a typology characterizing different forms of stream and river restoration, and we also analyzed nutrient retention across this typology. The studies we reviewed used a variety of methods to analyze nutrient cycling. We performed a further intensive meta -analysis on nutrient spiraling studies because this method was the most consistent and comparable between studies. A meta -analysis of 240 experimental additions of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was synthesized from 15 nutrient spiraling studies. Our results showed statistically significant relationships between nutrient uptake in restored streams and specific watershed attributes. Nitrate uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed surface area, impervious surface cover, and average reach width (p {\textless} 0.05). Ammonium uptake metrics were significantly related to discharge, velocity, and transient storage (p {\textless} 0.05). SRP uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed area, discharge, SRP concentrations, and chl a concentrations (p {\textless} 0.05). Given that most studies were conducted during baseflow, more research is necessary to characterize nutrient uptake during high flow. Furthermore, long-term studies are needed to understand changes in nutrient dynamics as projects evolve over time. Overall analysis suggests the size of the stream restoration (surface area), hydrologic connectivity, and hydrologic residence time are key drivers influencing nutrient retention at broader watershed scales and along the urban watershed continuum.},

	abstract = {Ecological memory is central to how ecosystems respond to disturbance and is maintained by two types of legacies - information and material. Species life-history traits represent an adaptive response to disturbance and are an information legacy; in contrast, the abiotic and biotic structures (such as seeds or nutrients) - produced by single disturbance events are material legacies. Disturbance characteristics that support or maintain these legacies enhance ecological resilience and maintain a "safe operating space" for ecosystem recovery. However, legacies can be lost or diminished as disturbance regimes and environmental conditions change, generating a "resilience debt" that manifests only after the system is disturbed. Strong effects of ecological memory on post-disturbance dynamics imply that contingencies (effects that cannot be predicted with certainty) of individual disturbances, interactions among disturbances, and climate variability combine to affect ecosystem resilience. We illustrate these concepts and introduce a novel ecosystem resilience framework with examples of forest disturbances, primarily from North America. Identifying legacies that support resilience in a particular ecosystem can help scientists and resource managers anticipate when disturbances may trigger abrupt shifts in forest ecosystems, and when forests are likely to be resilient.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification is a threat to many marine organisms, especially those that use calcium carbonate to form their shells and skeletons. The ability to accurately measure the carbonate system is the first step in characterizing the drivers behind this threat. Due to logistical realities, regular carbonate system sampling is not possible in many nearshore ocean habitats, particularly in remote, difficult-to-access locations. The ability to autonomously measure the carbonate system in situ relieves many of the logistical challenges; however, it is not always possible to measure the two required carbonate parameters autonomously. Observed relationships between sea surface salinity and total alkalinity can frequently provide a second carbonate parameter thus allowing for the calculation of the entire carbonate system. Here, we assessed the rigor of estimating total alkalinity from salinity at a depth {\textless}15 m by routinely sampling water from a pier in southern California for several carbonate system parameters. Carbonate system parameters based on measured values were compared with those based on estimated TA values. Total alkalinity was not predictable from salinity or from a combination of salinity and temperature at this site. However, dissolved inorganic carbon and the calcium carbonate saturation state of these nearshore surface waters could both be estimated within on average 5\% of measured values using measured pH and salinity-derived or regionally averaged total alkalinity. Thus we find that the autonomous measurement of pH and salinity can be used to monitor trends in coastal changes in DIC and saturation state and be a useful method for high-frequency, long-term monitoring of ocean acidification.},

We compared long-term patterns of concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in aquatic ecosystems of the Arbutus Lake watershed to evaluate how a lake nested in a forested watershed affects the sources (e.g., production) and sinks (e.g., retention) of DOC and DON in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. We observed no significant long-term changes of DOC and DON in the lake outlet since 1983 and 1994, respectively. However, the temporal patterns of DOC and DON concentrations in the lake inlet showed significant seasonality such as increases during the vegetation growing season along with notable decreases in the dormant season. A comparison of mass balances between inlet and outlet for the period from 2000 to 2009 suggested that the lake was a sink of DOC (mean of influx minus out flux: +1140 mol C ha(-1) yr(-1)). In contrast, the difference of discharge-weighted DON concentrations (mean of inlet minus outlet: 1.0 mu mol N L-1) between inlet and outlet was much smaller than the discharge-weighted DOC concentrations (average of inlet minus outlet: + 87 mu mol C L-1). DON fluxes showed considerable variation among years (mean of influx minus outflux: +8 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1); range of differences: -15 to 27 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1)). DON exhibited low percent retention ((influx-outflux)/influx) (mean: 6.9 \%, range: 34.8 to +31.2) compared to DOC (mean: 30.1 \%, range: +9.2 to +44.1). The resultant increase of DON within the lake was closely linked with a net decrease of DIN through monthly Pearson correlation analysis, suggesting the importance of biotic factors in mediating lake DON dynamics Our results show different relative retentions of DOC compared with DON, along with a larger retention of DIN than DON, suggesting that DOC and DON might display substantially different biogeochemical relationships in oligo-mesotrophic lakes nested forested watersheds and therefore different roles for a sink behavior for DOC compared to a producer of DON.},

In this study, we assessed the universality of the relationships between crop LAI and remotely sensed Vegetation Indices (VIs). We first compiled a global dataset of 1459 in situ quality-controlled crop LAI measurements and collected Landsat satellite images to derive five different VIs including Simple Ratio (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), two versions of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI and EVI2), and Green Chlorophyll Index (CIGreen). Based on this dataset, we developed global LAI-VI relationships for each crop type and VI using symbolic regression and Theil-Sen (TS) robust estimator. Results suggest that the global LAI-VI relationships are statistically significant, crop-specific, and mostly non-linear. These relationships explain more than half of the total variance in ground LAI observations (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.5), and provide LAI estimates with RMSE below 1.2 m(2)/m(2). Among the five VIs, EVI/EVI2 are the most effective, and the crop-specific LAI-EVI and LAI-EVI2 relationships constructed by TS, are robust when tested by three independent validation datasets of varied spatial scales. While the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes leads to a diverse set of local LAI-VI relationships, the relationships provided here represent global universality on an average basis, allowing the generation of large-scale spatial-explicit LAI maps. This study contributes to the operationalization of large-area crop modeling and, by extension, has relevance to both fundamental and applied agroecosystem research.},

Characterizing and developing high resolution albedo for an urban environment in arid regions is important because of the high urbanization rate in these regions and because of the high land-cover heterogeneity within urban settings. Using a Monte Carlo simulation of a multi-variable regression, we (a) correlate directional solar reflectance (albedo) ground measurements from Phoenix, AZ, with four narrowband reflectance data from QuickBird, and (b) developed a new set of coefficients for converting QuickBird narrowband reflectances to albedo. The albedo models were then applied to a second image over Las Vegas, NV, to assess their feasibility and accuracy. Two wavebands, visible-near infrared (VNIR) and total shortwave albedo, were evaluated for two reflectance models: surface and top-of-atmosphere. Results show that it is possible to accurately estimate directional albedo from high resolution imagery, specifically QuickBird, with the most accurate result from an atmospherically corrected VNIR model. The methodology presented in this paper could thus be applied in other urban areas to obtain a first order estimation of albedo. The new set of coefficients can be applied as first order albedo estimate by researchers, urban planners, developers and city managers interested in the influence of high-resolution albedo on a myriad of urban ecosystem processes.},

	abstract = {Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus; hereafter simply prairie dogs) strongly influence the structure and function of ecosystems, affecting several other species. Yet we know little about how arthropod populations respond to changes caused by prairie dogs. In this study, we examined the effects of black-tailed prairie dogs on the abundance and diversity of short-horned grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on the shortgrass steppe of the Pawnee National Grasslands in northeastern Colorado. We compared the abundance and diversity of grasshoppers on prairie dog colonies and comparable off colony sites using hoop nets. We further sampled vegetation at all sites using Daubenmire frames. We captured significantly fewer grasshoppers on prairie dog colonies than on control plots. At the sub-family level, we found that prairie dog colonies supported significantly more grasshoppers in the sub-family Oedipodinae, while off-colony sites had a non-significant trend toward more Gomphocerinae grasshoppers. We found very similar mean site diversity (i.e., alpha diversity) on colony and off-colony sites, but relatively large differences in beta diversity (i.e., diversity across sites), suggesting that prairie dog colonies have an impact on short-horned grasshopper abundances and species composition on short grass steppe habitats.

	abstract = {Runoff of agricultural nutrients and sediments has led to re-eutrophication of lakes and impaired stream health in the Great Lakes Basin since around 2000 following earlier success in protecting water quality. Substantial investment in conservation actions has had insufficient impact, due in part to a limited basis for understanding the likely environmental outcomes of those investments. This article introduces a special section focusing on promoting investment that produces environmental outcomes as opposed to investing in conservation actions with unknown effects. The special section contains articles in three main categories: 1) studies based on fine-grain SWAT and other simulation modeling that can guide the type, amount, and location of conservation investments to increase their environmental impact; 2) edge-of-field measurement studies that provide updated knowledge to assist in further refining models to increase their predictive power; and 3) articles presenting innovative approaches to incentivizing outcome-oriented conservation investment. Implementation approaches discussed include certifying private crop nutrient advisors as recommending only appropriate timing, amount, and placement of nutrients; working within the existing public drain management system to incentivize conservation; and others. The special section shows that advances in SWAT modeling provide a powerful basis for targeting conservation investments to protect water quality in the Great Lakes Basin, while also demonstrating opportunities to further refine the models. It illustrates both the opportunity and the need to engage in more innovative institutional design of agricultural management programs that go beyond the traditional government programs and do more to reward outcomes and not just actions.

Here we show that dissolved black carbon can persist in freshwater and saline surface waters for thousands of years, while preserving the chemical signature of the original source materials. The ancient brines of the lake bottom waters have retained dissolved black carbon with a woody chemical signature, representing long-range transport of black carbon from wildfires. In contrast, the surface waters are enriched in contemporary black carbon from fossil fuel combustion. Comparison of samples collected 25years apart from the same lake suggests that the enrichment in anthropogenic black carbon is recent. Differences in the chemical composition of dissolved black carbon among the lakes are likely due to biogeochemical processing such as photochemical degradation and sorption on metal oxides.},

Climate influences on arctic river temperatures can be particularly important due to corresponding effects on nutrient dynamics and ecological responses. It was hypothesized that the same heat and mass fluxes affect arctic and temperate rivers, but that relative importance and variability over time and space differ. Through data collection and application of a river temperature model that accounts for the primary heat fluxes relevant in temperate climates, heat fluxes were estimated for a large arctic basin over wide ranges of hydrologic conditions. Heat flux influences similar to temperate systems included dominant shortwave radiation, shifts from positive to negative sensible heat flux with distance downstream, and greater influences of lateral inflows in the headwater region. Heat fluxes that differed from many temperate systems included consistently negative net longwave radiation and small average latent heat fluxes. Radiative heat fluxes comprised 88\% of total absolute heat flux while all other heat fluxes contributed less than 5\% on average. Periodic significance was seen for lateral inflows (up to 26\%) and latent heat flux (up to 18\%) in the lower and higher stream order portions of the watershed, respectively. Evenly distributed lateral inflows from large scale flow differencing and temperatures from representative tributaries provided a data efficient method for estimating the associated heat loads. Poor model performance under low flows demonstrated need for further testing and data collection to support the inclusion of additional heat fluxes.},

We find that marsh loss is nearly inevitable where topographic and anthropogenic barriers limit migration. Where unconstrained by barriers, however, rates of marsh migration are much more sensitive to accelerated sea level rise than rates of edge erosion. This behavior suggests a counterintuitive, natural tendency for marsh expansion with sea level rise and emphasizes the disparity between coastal response to climate change with and without human intervention.},

For four of the five species, there was no relationship; however, for one species a consistent effect was identified, whereby the volume harvested and number of harvest events were found to be significantly related to stumpage price, west of the Connecticut River. This effect is absent for eastern Massachusetts, and also not apparent consistently for other species. It is concluded that under some circumstances, private landowner harvest decisions are influenced by stumpage price.},

Such genomic information can shed light on the agents and targets of selection maintaining cooperation in nature. We recently demonstrated that N-fertilization has caused an evolutionary decline in mutualistic partner quality in the rhizobia that form symbiosis with clover. Here, population genomic analyses of N-fertilized versus control rhizobium populations indicate that evolutionary differentiation at a key symbiosis gene region on the symbiotic plasmid (pSym) contributes to partner quality decline. Moreover, patterns of genetic variation at selected loci were consistent with recent positive selection within N-fertilized environments, suggesting that N-rich environments might select for less beneficial rhizobia. By studying the molecular population genomics of a natural bacterial population within a long-term ecological field experiment, we find that: (i) the N environment is indeed a potent selective force mediating mutualism evolution in this symbiosis, (ii) natural variation in rhizobium partner quality is mediated in part by key symbiosis genes on the symbiotic plasmid, and (iii) differentiation at selected genes occurred in the context of otherwise recombining genomes, resembling eukaryotic models of adaptation.},

Foliar N and P along with leaf area are among the most important controls on photosynthesis and hence productivity. However, foliar N and P are typically assessed as species level traits, whereas productivity is often measured at the community scale. Here, we compared the community-level traits of leaf area index (LAI) to total foliar nitrogen (TFN) and total foliar phosphorus (TFP) across nearly three orders of magnitude LAI in grazed and ungrazed tallgrass prairie in north-eastern Kansas, USA. LAI was strongly correlated with both TFN and TFP across communities, and also within plant functional types (grass, forb, woody, and sedge) and grazing treatments (bison or cattle, and ungrazed). Across almost the entire range of LAI values and contrasting communities, TFN:TFP ratios indicated co-limitation by N and P in almost all communities; this may further indicate a community scale trend of an optimal N and P allocation per unit leaf area for growth. Previously, results from the arctic showed similar tight relationships between LAI:TFN, suggesting N is supplied to canopies to maximize photosynthesis per unit leaf area. This tight coupling between LAI, N, and P in tallgrass prairie suggests a process of optimal allocation of N and P, wherein LAI remains similarly constrained by N and P despite differences in species composition, grazing, and canopy density.},

However, on the majority of such islands, including Moorea (French Polynesia), SGD has not been studied. In this study, we used radium (Ra) isotopes and salinity to investigate SGD and associated nutrient inputs at five coastal sites and Paopao Bay on the north shore of Moorea. Ra activities were highest in coastal groundwater, intermediate in coastal ocean surface water, and lowest in offshore surface water, indicating that high-Ra groundwater was discharging into the coastal ocean. On average, groundwater nitrate and nitrite (N + N), phosphate, ammonium, and silica concentrations were 12, 21, 29, and 33 times greater, respectively, than those in coastal ocean surface water, suggesting that groundwater discharge could be an important source of nutrients to the coastal ocean. Ra and salinity mass balances indicated that most or all SGD at these sites was saline and likely originated from a deeper, unsampled layer of Ra-enriched recirculated seawater. This high-salinity SGD may be less affected by terrestrial nutrient sources, such as fertilizer, sewage, and animal waste, compared to meteoric groundwater; however, nutrient-salinity trends indicate it may still have much higher concentrations of nitrate and phosphate than coastal receiving waters. Coastal ocean nutrient concentrations were virtually identical to those measured offshore, suggesting that nutrient subsidies from SGD are efficiently utilized.},

In cold regions, these changes may bring about a shift in the frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs), which represent a significant physiological challenge, especially for small, poikilothermic animals with limited mobility. To assess the impact of FTCs on cold-adapted soil biota, we evaluated freeze-thaw dynamics (i.e., 0 A degrees C crossings) and demographics of the dominant nematode Scottnema lindsayae (proportion of adults, population size) over 20 years in soils at two locations in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Based on hourly soil temperature data, we demonstrate that FTCs are a frequent feature in Taylor Valley, but with high inter-annual and spatial variability. Valley topography and soil moisture were found to impact FTC frequency, suggesting that basins within Taylor Valley have different susceptibilities to environmental variability. Increased FTC frequency in 1999-2001 coincided with a shift in S. lindsayae populations, with fewer juveniles reaching maturity. In the years following decreased adult proportions, overall S. lindsayae numbers were reduced, implying a strong negative effect of FTCs on in situ recruitment. Our results suggest that increased FTC frequency in the Dry Valleys slows S. lindsayae development, reducing reproductive success, and may take years to impact population size, which demonstrates the importance of long-term research to accurately predict the consequences of climate change on soil biota and biogeochemical cycling in the cold regions.},

With warmer temperatures, new hydrologic pathways are developing in these regions and increasing dissolved nutrient fluxes. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, thermokarsting may release both nutrients and sediment, and has the potential to influence mats in glacial meltwater streams. To test the role of nutrient inputs on community structure, we created nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) with agar enriched in N, P and N + P, with controls, and deployed them into two Dry Valley streams. We found N amendments (N and N + P) to have greater chlorophyll-a concentrations, total algal biovolume, more fine filamentous cyanobacteria and a higher proportion of live diatoms than other treatments. Furthermore, N treatments were substantially elevated in Bacteroidetes and the small diatom, Fistulifera pelliculosa. On the other hand, species richness was almost double in P and N + P treatments over others, and coccoid green algae and Proteobacteria were more abundant in both streams. Collectively, these data suggest that nutrients have the potential to stimulate growth and alter community structure in glacial meltwater stream microbial mats, and the recent erosion of permafrost and accelerated glacial melt will likely impact resident biota in polar lotic systems here and elsewhere.},

As such, ecologists have long sought to understand the factors driving variation in this important ecosystem process. Although total annual precipitation has been shown to be a strong predictor of ANPP in grasslands across broad spatial scales, it is often a poor predictor at local scales. Here we examine the amount of variation in ANPP that can be explained by total annual precipitation versus precipitation during specific periods of the year (precipitation periods) and nutrient availability at three sites representing the major grassland types (shortgrass steppe, mixed-grass prairie, and tallgrass prairie) spanning the broad precipitation gradient of the U.S. Central Great Plains. Using observational data, we found that precipitation periods and nutrient availability were much stronger predictors of site-level ANPP than total annual precipitation. However, the specific nutrients and precipitation periods that best predicted ANPP differed among the three sites. These effects were mirrored experimentally at the shortgrass and tallgrass sites, with precipitation and nutrient availability co-limiting ANPP, but not at the mixed-grass site, where nutrient availability determined ANPP exclusive of precipitation effects. Dominant grasses drove the ANPP response to increased nutrient availability at all three sites. However, the relative responses of rare grasses and forbs were greater than those of the dominant grasses to experimental nutrient additions, thus potentially driving species turnover with chronic nutrient additions. This improved understanding of the factors driving variation in ANPP within ecosystems spanning the broad precipitation gradient of the Great Plains will aid predictions of alterations in ANPP under future global change scenarios.},

We assessed: (1) the effects of experimental soil nutrient additions on invertebrate abundances and feeding rates and (2) the resultant changes in the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass at three grassland sites spanning the North American Central Plains, across which plant tissue chemistry and biomass vary. Invertebrate communities and rates of herbivory were sampled within a long-term nutrient-addition experiment established at each site along the broad Central Plains precipitation gradient. Additionally, the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass were determined under ambient and elevated nutrient conditions. At the more mesic sites, invertebrate herbivore abundances increased and their per capita rate of herbivory decreased with nutrient additions. In contrast, at the semi-arid site where plant biomass is low and plant nutrient concentrations are high, invertebrate herbivore abundances did not vary and per capita rates of herbivory increased with nutrient additions. No change in the effect of invertebrate herbivores on aboveground plant biomass was observed at any of the sites. In sum, nutrient additions induced shifts in both plant biomass and leaf nutrient content, which altered invertebrate abundances and feeding rate. However, due to the inverse relationship between changes in herbivore abundance and per capita rates of herbivory, nutrient additions did not alter the effect of invertebrates on aboveground biomass. Overall, we suggest that this inverse response of herbivore abundance and per capita feeding rate may buffer ecosystems against changes in invertebrate damage in response to fluctuations in nutrient levels.},

Here we assess cover crop effects on soil organic C in 20 large agricultural fields across a topographically diverse landscape under conventional, low-input, and organic managements in corn-soybean-wheat rotation. The low-input and organic managements included rye and red clover cover crops in their rotations. Micro-plots with and without cover crops were laid out within each studied field at three contrasting topographical positions of depression, slope and summit. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and short-term mineralizable carbon (SMC). The magnitude of cover crop effects on SMC and POC varied across topography. The contributions of cover crop's presence to soil C variables tended to be the highest on topographical slopes and summits. Positive correlations between effects of cover crop presence on SMC with cover crop biomass also were primarily observed on slopes and summits. The results indicate that in the studied agricultural environments preferential placement of cover crops on eroded low fertility elements of the relief can be a particularly effective strategy from both environmental and management standpoints.

In many temperate systems, it is unclear how winter climate relates to biotic responses during the growing season. The objective of this study was to examine how winter weather relates to plant and animal communities in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems ranging from warm deserts to alpine tundra. Specifically, we examined the association between winter weather and plant phenology, plant species richness, consumer abundance, and consumer richness in 11 terrestrial ecosystems associated with the U.S. Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network. To varying degrees, winter precipitation and temperature were correlated with all biotic response variables. Bud break was tightly aligned with end of winter temperatures. For half the sites, winter weather was a better predictor of plant species richness than growing season weather. Warmer winters were correlated with lower consumer abundances in both temperate and alpine systems. Our findings suggest winter weather may have a strong influence on biotic activity during the growing season and should be considered in future studies investigating the effects of climate change on both alpine and temperate systems.},

Samples were analyzed for major ions, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, delta O-18, and delta H-2. Chemical modeling and a coupled principal component analysis and end-member mixing model were used to identify three groundwater sources that discharge to the coastal wetlands and estuaries of the SKBR. A sulfate-dominated and a calcium-dominated fresh groundwater source were found to contribute significantly to the headwaters of a southern and northern SKBR estuary, respectively. In the northern part of the Reserve, an elevated road disrupts the flow of freshwater through the estuarine zone creating hypersaline conditions and mangrove dead-zones. In a more pristine estuary to the south, coastal groundwater discharge associated with petens (tree islands) accounted for similar to 20 \% of the surface water in the mid-estuary. This coastal groundwater discharge from the petens adds a significant amount of phosphorus to the surface water in the estuary relative to the upstream and downstream sources. The lower alkalinity measured in the surface water relative to the high-alkalinity groundwater, despite clear indication of groundwater discharge, suggests that inorganic carbon export through degassing of CO2 could represent important carbon process in mangrove ecosystems. Our results indicate an important groundwater discharge mechanism that may facilitate nutrient delivery to karstic, oligotrophic estuaries when upland and marine nutrient supplies are depleted.},

	abstract = {Lowland boreal forest ecosystems in Alaska are dominated by wetlands comprised of a complex mosaic of fens, collapse-scar bogs, low shrub/scrub, and forests growing on elevated ice-rich permafrost soils. Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within similar to 0.5 degrees C of thawing. Increased permafrost thaw in lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30x30m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, while gradient boosting/regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950 and 2009, landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of similar to 15km(2) or similar to 7\% of birch forests to wetlands, where the greatest change followed warm periods. This work highlights that the vulnerability and resilience of lowland ice-rich permafrost ecosystems to climate changes depend on forest type.},

	abstract = {Invasive species have substantial impacts across the globe. While management efforts should aim to minimize undesirable impacts, we have a poor understanding of how impacts of a given invasive species vary spatially. Here, we develop a framework for considering heterogeneity of invasive species impacts that allows us to explore the range of possible spatial patterns of impact. This framework incorporates two factorshow invasive species abundance varies among sites (i.e., abundance distributions) and how invasive species impact varies as a function of abundance (i.e., abundance-impact curves). Combining these two factors allows for the creation of probability distributions that represent how invasive species impacts may vary spatially among sites. We used published abundance distributions and inferred abundance-impact curves to generate impact distributions for two problematic invasive specieszebra mussel and Eurasian watermilfoilacross lakes in Wisconsin, USA. Impact distributions of these species tended to be right-skewed (i.e., the majority of sites had low impacts), although the tail thickness varied. We also simulated how a broader range of combinations of invasive species abundance distributions and abundance-impact curves produce different patterns of invasive species impact. These simulations illustrate a remarkable diversity of invasive species spatial impact patternsprobability distributions of impact were left-skewed, right-skewed, bimodal, and normal. Total landscape-level impacts, estimated by summing site-level impacts, were similarly variable depending on the distribution of site-level impacts. Our results indicate that invasive species abundance and abundance-impact curves ultimately affect how invasive species impacts are distributed across the landscape, which has important implications for invasive species management.},

Although many factors have been identified as influencing DOM fluxes and biochemical quality in rivers with varying land cover types, controls on DOM composition in forested headwater catchments of the western U.S. are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of hydrologic patterns and forest management history on stream DOM chemistry at watersheds located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest of the Oregon Cascades. Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), generally indicative of aromaticity, increased in streams during storms with increasing surficial soil horizon and litter DOM inputs. Fluorescence excitation and emission matrices (EEMs) with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) identified a protein-like DOM fluorescent component as well as several other components associated with terrestrial plant material. Correlation analysis between the protein-like DOM component and hydrologic patterns, SUVA(254), and DOC concentrations suggest that DOM during dry seasons represents more microbially-processed sources, such as protein-rich, deeper soil or DOM with greater in-stream microbial processing, compared to more plant-like surface soil sources observed during high flow. The base flow index (the proportion of base flow to total flow) showed a high correlation with the relative proportion of protein-like DOM indicating that deep soil water is a source of the protein-like signal. The relative proportions of the protein-like DOM and humic DOM were also influenced by the abundance of coarse woody debris (CWD), but not live tree biomass, with the proportions of protein like DOM highest in harvested watersheds with low surficial CWD. This study shows UV and fluorescent spectroscopy is a viable finger printing method to elucidate DOM sources in pristine headwater streams at the western Cascades of Oregon.

We conducted a survey of several drug residues, including the potentially illicit drug amphetamine, at 6 stream sites along an urban to rural gradient in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. We detected numerous drugs, including amphetamine (3 to 630 ng L-1), in all stream sites. We examined the fate and ecological effects of amphetamine on biofilm, seston, and aquatic insect communities in artificial streams exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g L-1) of amphetamine. The amphetamine parent compound decreased in the artificial streams from less than 1 mu g L-1 on day 1 to 0.11 mu g L-1 on day 22. In artificial streams treated with amphetamine, there was up to 45\% lower biofilm chlorophyll a per ash-free dry mass, 85\% lower biofilm gross primary production, 24\% greater seston ash-free dry mass, and 30\% lower seston community respiration compared to control streams. Exposing streams to amphetamine also changed the composition of bacterial and diatom communities in biofilms at day 21 and increased cumulative dipteran emergence by 65\% and 89\% during the first and third weeks of the experiment, respectively. This study demonstrates that amphetamine and other biologically active drugs are present in urban streams and have the potential to affect both structure and function of stream communities.},

	abstract = {We detect transition to agropastoral land use in a mountain landscape by radiocarbon dating physical signatures (sedimentation rates, charcoal concentrations, magnetic susceptibility) of conversion from native forest to pasture contained within colluvial stratigraphic sections. Focus is on two study sites located on toeslopes directly beneath zero-order hollows draining several hectares in the commune of Larrau (Pyrenees Atlantiques, France) along the international drainage divide of the western Pyrenees. Sample sites maximize likelihood of spatially and temporally uniform slopewash sedimentation. This constitutes a place-based approach to decipher the chronology of agropastoral activities within individual fields, which is applicable to other mountain ranges of the world. Stratigraphic columns were augured in contiguous 10 cm sample levels, which produced temporal resolution of decades to several centuries. We interpret relatively high concentrations of charcoal, rapid sedimentation, and magnetic susceptibility patterns as evidence of the intentional use of fire to transform forests into pastures. Results indicate that intentional burning and clearing probably were initiated by the Late Neolithic (ca. 5000 -6000 cal. BP). However, intense burning, extensive forest clearance, and erosional degradation occurred later during the Bronze Age at one site, and during the Iron Age at the other site. This non-synchronous pattern of charcoal abundance and sedimentation rates is consistent with human agency of land clearance driving the chronology rather than paleoclimatic drivers. Stratigraphic zones of rapid sedimentation at both sites constitute "legacy" sediment of great antiquity. Our results are consistent with similar shifts in fire regimes and vegetation assemblages derived from direct association with anthropogenic proxies (e.g. pastoral pollen taxa, fungal spores of sheep dung, and archaeological sites) elsewhere in the Pyrenees and other European mountains. Consequently, our method may provide a good indicator of human presence and land-use activities for mountainous areas where paleoenvironmental records from bogs, lakes, and archaeological sites are limited.

	abstract = {The concentration of nitrogen (N) in foliage often limits photosynthesis and can influence a number of important biogeochemical processes. For this reason, methods for estimating foliar \%N over a range of scales are needed to enhance understanding of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. High spectral resolution aircraft remote sensing has become an increasingly common tool for landscape-scale estimates of canopy \%N because reflectance in some portions of the spectrum has been shown to correlate strongly with field-measured \%N. These patterns have been observed repeatedly over a wide range of biomes, opening new possibilities for planned Earth observation satellites. Nevertheless, the effects of spectral resolution and other sensor characteristics on \%N estimates have not been fully examined, and may have implications for future analyses at landscape, regional and global scales. In this study, we explored the effects of spectral resolution, spatial resolution and sensor fidelity on relationships between forest canopy \%N and reflectance measurements from airborne and satellite platforms. We conducted an exercise whereby PLS, simple and multiple regression calibrations to field-measured canopy \%N for a series of forested sites were iteratively performed using (1) high resolution data from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) that were degraded spectrally from 10 nm to 30 nm, 50 nm, 70 nm, and 90 nm bandwidths, and spatially from 18 m to 30 m and 60 m pixels; (2) data representing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) spectral bands simulated with data from AVIRIS; and (3) actual data from Landsat and MODIS. We observed virtually no reduction in the strength of relationships between \%N and reflectance when using coarser bandwidths from AVIRIS, but instead saw declines with increasing spatial resolution and loss of sensor fidelity. This suggests that past efforts to examine foliar \%N using broad-band sensors may have been limited as much by the latter two properties as by their coarser spectral bandwidths. We also found that regression models were driven primarily by reflectance over broad portions of the near infrared (NIR) region, with little contribution from the visible or mid infrared regions. These results suggest that much of the variability in canopy \%N is related to broad reflectance properties in the NIR region, indicating promise for broad scale canopy N estimation from a variety of sensors.

In desert grasslands of the southwestern US, the loss of fire has been implicated as a primary cause of shrub encroachment. Where fires can currently be re-introduced given past state changes and recent restoration actions, however, is unknown and controversial. Our objective was to evaluate the interactive effects of climate, urban development, and topo-edaphic properties on fire distribution in the desert grassland region of the southwestern United States. We characterized the spatial distribution of fire in the Chihuahuan Desert and Madrean Archipelago ecoregions and investigated the influence of soil properties and ecological site groups compared to other commonly used biophysical variables using multi-model inference. Soil-landscape properties significantly influenced the spatial distribution of fire ignitions. Fine-textured bottomland ecological site classes experienced more fires than expected in contrast to upland sites with coarse soil textures and high fragment content that experienced fewer fire ignitions than expected. Influences of mean annual precipitation, distance to road/rail, soil available water holding capacity (AWHC) and topographic variables varied between ecoregions and political jurisdictions and by fire season. AWHC explained more variability of fire ignitions in the Madrean Archipelago compared to the Chihuahuan Desert. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of recent fires in desert grasslands is needed to manage fire and predict responses to climate change. The use of landscape units such as ecological sites presents an opportunity to improve predictions at management scales.},

	abstract = {The pace and degree of nutrient limitation are among the most critical uncertainties in predicting terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change. In the northeastern United States, forest growth has recently declined along with decreased soil calcium (Ca) availability, suggesting that acid rain has depleted soil Ca to the point where it may be a limiting nutrient. However, it is unknown whether the past 60 y of changes in Ca availability are strictly anthropogenic or partly a natural consequence of long-term ecosystem development. Here, we report a high-resolution millennial-scale record of Ca and 16 other elements from the sediments of Mirror Lake, a 15-ha lake in the White Mountains of New Hampshire surrounded by northern hardwood forest. We found that sedimentary Ca concentrations had been declining steadily for 900 y before regional Euro-American settlement. This Ca decline was not a result of serial episodic disturbances but instead the gradual weathering of soils and soil Ca availability. As Ca availability was declining, nitrogen availability concurrently was increasing. These data indicate that nutrient availability on base-poor, parent materials is sensitive to acidifying processes on millennial timescales. Forest harvesting and acid rain in the postsettlement period mobilized significant amounts of Ca from watershed soils, but these effects were exacerbated by the long-term pattern. Shifting nutrient limitation can potentially occur within 10,000 y of ecosystem development, which alters our assessments of the speed and trajectory of nutrient limitation in forests, and could require reformulation of global models of forest productivity.},

	abstract = {The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone-US\$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation-is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the performance of formal programs associated with tree plantings in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD to understand the relationships between the implementation of urban greening programs and the social and ecological characteristics of a city. Previous research has examined variations in patterns of existing and possible tree canopy cover relative to different social theories. Less attention has been paid to the processes of how the current patterns of tree canopy cover have developed. The goal of this paper is to address this gap by examining current programs to increase tree canopy. This paper utilizes public records, administrative data, a geodemographic market segmentation database, and high-resolution land cover data to assess where programs work, who participates in these programs, and whom the programs fail to reach. Recruiting households to plant trees can be hard work. In this paper, we find that programs might be most successful where it is easiest but have the lowest need. Free or reduced-cost programs for tree planting on private lands were most effective in the most affluent neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD. These areas tended to also have the most existing tree canopy on both private residential lands and the public right of way. An outcome of this research is a framework for further testing which land management strategies are most effective, where, and with whom in order to improve the ability to plan and enhance urban sustainability and resilience through urban forestry.},

We analyzed C, N, microbial biomass C and root length in closely paired soil samples taken under versus 20-50 cm away from large trunks of two species felled by Hugo (1989) and Georges (1998) three times during wet and dry seasons over the two years following the study conducted by Georges. Soil microbial biomass, \% C and \% N were significantly higher under than away from logs felled by both hurricanes (i.e., 1989 and 1998), at all sampling times and at both depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm). Frass from wood boring beetles may contribute to early effects. Root length was greater away from logs during the dry season, and under logs in the wet season. Root length was correlated with microbial biomass C, soil N and soil moisture (R = 0.36, 0.18, and 0.27, respectively; all p values {\textless} 0.05). Microbial biomass C varied significantly among seasons but differences between positions (under vs. away) were only suggestive. Microbial C was correlated with soil N (R = 0.35). Surface soil on the upslope side of the logs had significantly more N and microbial biomass, likely from accumulation of leaf litter above the logs on steep slopes. We conclude that decaying wood can provide ephemeral resources that are exploited by tree roots during some seasons.},

	abstract = {Alkenones are a class of unsaturated long-chain ketone biomarkers that have been used to reconstruct sea surface temperature and, more recently, continental temperature, by way of alkenone unsaturation indices (e.g. U-37(K) and U-37(K')). Alkenones are frequently found in brackish and saline lakes, however species effects confound temperature reconstructions when multiple alkenone-producing species with different temperature responses are present. Interestingly, available genetic data indicate that numerous freshwater lakes host a distinct phylotype of alkenone-producing haptophyte algae (the Group I or Greenland phylotype), providing evidence that species effects may be diminished in freshwater lakes. These findings encourage further investigation of alkenone paleotemperature proxies in freshwater systems. Here, we investigated lakes from northern Alaska (n = 35) and show that alkenones commonly occurred in freshwater lakes, where they featured distinct distributions, characterized by dominant C-37:4 alkenones and a series of tri-unsaturated alkenone isomers. The distributions were characteristic of Group I-type alkenone distributions previously identified in Greenland and North America. Our analysis of suspended particulate matter from Toolik Lake (68 degrees 38'N, 14 degrees 36'W) yielded the first in situ freshwater U-37(K) calibration (U-37(K)= 0.021 * T -0.68; r(2) = 0.85; n = 52; RMSE = +/- 1.37 degrees C). We explored the environmental significance of the tri-unsaturated isomers using our northern Alaskan lakes dataset in conjunction with new data from haptophyte cultures and Canadian surface sediments. Our results show that these temperature-sensitive isomers are biomarkers for the Group I phylotype and indicators of multiple-species effects. Together, these findings highlight freshwater lakes as valuable targets for continental alkenone-based paleotemperature reconstructions and demonstrate the significance of the recently discovered tri-unsaturated isomers.

	abstract = {We review and synthesize information on invasions of nonnative forest insects and diseases in the United States, including their ecological and economic impacts, pathways of arrival, distribution within the United States, and policy options for reducing future invasions. Nonnative insects have accumulated in United States forests at a rate of similar to 2.5 per yr over the last 150 yr. Currently the two major pathways of introduction are importation of live plants and wood packing material such as pallets and crates. Introduced insects and diseases occur in forests and cities throughout the United States, and the problem is particularly severe in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nonnative forest pests are the only disturbance agent that has effectively eliminated entire tree species or genera from United States forests within decades. The resulting shift in forest structure and species composition alters ecosystem functions such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In urban and suburban areas, loss of trees from streets, yards, and parks affects aesthetics, property values, shading, stormwater runoff, and human health. The economic damage from nonnative pests is not yet fully known, but is likely in the billions of dollars per year, with the majority of this economic burden borne by municipalities and residential property owners. Current policies for preventing introductions are having positive effects but are insufficient to reduce the influx of pests in the face of burgeoning global trade. Options are available to strengthen the defenses against pest arrival and establishment, including measures taken in the exporting country prior to shipment, measures to ensure clean shipments of plants and wood products, inspections at ports of entry, and post-entry measures such as quarantines, surveillance, and eradication programs. Improved data collection procedures for inspections, greater data accessibility, and better reporting would support better evaluation of policy effectiveness. Lack of additional action places the nation, local municipalities, and property owners at high risk of further damaging and costly invasions. Adopting stronger policies to reduce establishments of new forest insects and diseases would shift the major costs of control to the source and alleviate the economic burden now borne by homeowners and municipalities.},

	abstract = {Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) is used to measure gas concentrations in aqueous samples, and is often employed to measure N-2 in denitrification studies. While most denitrification studies using MIMS have employed the N-2:Ar method, MIMS is increasingly used with the isotope pairing technique (IPT), an alternative method that calculates denitrification based on N-29(2) and N-30(2) concentrations, measured as mass to charge ratios (m/z) 29 and 30. Dissolved O-2 is known to interfere with m/z 28 and 40 (N-28(2) and Ar, respectively) in the MIMS, and in this study, we show that the effect on m/z 29 and 30 is also significant. This O-2 effect may result in artificially high denitrification rates with IPT if O-2 varies between samples. In lab-based experiments, m/z 29 and 30 were impacted immediately as O-2 was depleted. The resulting effect on simulated denitrification rates was minor if final O-2 concentrations remained above 50\% initial O-2, but increased by more than 100 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) as O-2 fell below 50\%. Similarly, denitrification rates from sediment incubations were an order of magnitude higher when analyzed in the presence of O-2, compared with analysis without O-2 using an inline furnace with reduction column. We further show that this effect is variable over the life of the MIMS, and/or with different ion sources. Given these uncertainties, we recommend using an inline furnace to remove O-2 for all IPT experiments. Alternatively, the magnitude of the O-2 effect should be assessed often to determine the range of minimal O-2 interference.},

	abstract = {The one-dimensional hydrodynamic ice model, DYRESM-WQ-I, was modified to simulate ice cover and thermal structure of dimictic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, over a continuous 104-year period (1911-2014). The model results were then used to examine the drivers of changes in ice cover and water temperature, focusing on the responses to shifts in air temperature, wind speed, and water clarity at multiyear timescales. Observations of the drivers include a change in the trend of warming air temperatures from 0.081 degrees C per decade before 1981 to 0.334 degrees C per decade thereafter, as well as a shift in mean wind speed from 4.44 ms(-1) before 1994 to 3.74 ms(-1) thereafter. Observations show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover: later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice thickness (12.7 cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3 days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer hypolimnetic temperatures (-1.4 degrees C per century). Correlation analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature, stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration, epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911-1980, 1981-1993, and 1994-2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after 1994, which was related in part to the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998. Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate a significant difference in the third period (1994-2014), when air temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these variables will respond in a future climate.},

To evaluate changes in ecosystem productivity, we measured temporal patterns of CO2 and the normalized difference vegetation index over the study period. Both water levels and distance from the coast influenced the ecosystem response to low-temperature events. Photosynthetic capacity, or the maximum CO2 uptake rate, and sensitivity to low-temperature events were much higher in mangrove forest than in freshwater marsh ecosystems. During low-temperature events photosynthetic capacity was enhanced in freshwater marsh while it declined in mangrove forests, and respiration rates declined across Everglades ecosystems. While the long hydroperiod freshwater marsh gained 0.26 g CO2 m(-2) during low-temperature events, the mangrove forest had the greatest C lost (7.11 g CO2 m(-2) low-temperature event(-1)) followed by the short hydroperiod freshwater marsh (0.37 g CO2 m(-2) low-temperature event(-1)). Results suggest that shifts in the frequency and intensity of weather anomalies with climate change can alter C assimilation rates in Everglades ecosystems through effects on the photosynthetic capacity of existing species, which might lead to changes in species composition and ecosystem productivity in the future.},

Inter-comparison studies are commonly performed to keep the user community informed on the consistency and accuracy of such records as they evolve. In this study, we compared two new records: (1) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index version 3 (NDVI3g) and (2) Vegetation Index and Phenology Lab (VIP) version 3 NDVI (NDVI3v) and enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI3v). We evaluated the two records via three experiments that addressed the primary use of such records in global change research: (1) leaf area index (LAI), (2) vegetation climatology, and (3) trend analysis of the magnitude and timing of vegetation productivity. Unlike previous global studies, a unique Landsat 30m spatial resolution and in situ LAI database for major crop types on five continents was used to evaluate the performance of not only NDVI3g and NDVI3v but also EVI3v. The performance of NDVI3v and EVI3v was worse than NDVI3g using the in situ data, which was attributed to the fusion of GIMMS and MODIS data in the VIP record. EVI3v has the potential to contribute biophysical information beyond NDVI3g and NDVI3v to global change studies, but we caution its use due to the poor performance of EVI3v in this study. Overall, the records were most consistent at northern latitudes during the primary growing season and southern latitudes and the tropics throughout much of the year, while the records were less consistent at northern latitudes during green-up and senescence, and in the great deserts of the world throughout much of the year. These patterns led to general agreement (disagreement) between trends in the magnitude (timing) of NDVI over the study period. Bias in inter-calibration of the VIP record at northernmost latitudes was suspected to contribute most to these discrepancies.},

Here, we utilized 9 months of. data in two semiarid ecosystems of North America to investigate the key relationship between the spatial mean ({\textless}theta {\textgreater}) and standard deviation (sigma(theta)) at the field-scale (similar to 100m). Analyses revealed a strong seasonal control on the sigma(theta) versus {\textless}theta {\textgreater} relation and the existence of hysteretic cycles where wetting and dry-down phases have notably different behavior. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) showed that. variability depends on two dominant spatial patterns, with time-stable and seasonally varying contributions in time, respectively. Correlations between EOFs and land surface properties also indicated that. patterns are linked to vegetation (terrain and soil) factors at the site with higher (lower) vegetation cover. These physical controls explained the observed hysteresis cycles, thus confirming interpretations from previous modeling studies for the first time.},

In this research project, we are monitoring swamp vegetation dynamics over decadal timescales and relating observed changes to environmental factors. We have also modelled potential effects of climate change on swamp distributions. We found that swamp communities are spatially dynamic, both internally and in relation to the woodland matrix. Transitions between communities depended on initial states. In addition, these water-dependent communities appeared highly sensitive to projected climate change and their Endangered' status makes their active management a high priority. Improved understanding of dynamics at the community and landscape scale facilitates horizon scanning and improves our capacity to plan effective management interventions now and under future management and climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Agricultural crop rotations have been shown to increase soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and microbial biomass. The mechanisms behind these increases remain unclear, but may be linked to the diversity of crop residue inputs to soil organic matter (SOM). We used a residue mixture incubation to examine how variation in long-term diversity of plant communities in agroecosystems influences decomposition of residue mixtures, thus providing a comparison of the effects of plant diversification on decomposition in the long term (via crop rotation) and short term (via residue mixtures). Three crop residue mixtures, ranging in diversity from two to four species, were incubated for 360 d with soils from five crop rotations, ranging from monoculture corn (mC) to a complex five-crop rotation. In response, we measured fundamental soil pools and processes underlying C and N cycling. These included soil respiration, inorganic N, microbial biomass, and extracellular enzymes. We hypothesized that soils with more diverse cropping histories would show greater synergistic mixture effects than mC. For most variables (except extracellular enzymes), crop rotation history, or the long-term history of plant diversity in the field, had a stronger effect on soil processes than mixture composition. In contrast to our hypothesis, the mC soil had nearly three and seven times greater synergistic mixture effects for respiration and microbial biomass N, respectively, compared with soils from crop rotations. This was due to the low response of the mC soils to poor quality residues (corn and wheat), likely resulting from a lack of available C and nutrients to cometabolize these residues. These results indicate that diversifying crop rotations in agricultural systems alter the decomposition dynamics of new residue inputs, which may be linked to the benefits of increasing crop rotation diversity on soil nutrient cycling, SOM dynamics, and yields.},

Thus, we monitored the chemical composition of Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem grass) litter residue over a 36 month decomposition experiment in a prairie ecosystem using: traditional wet chemical fractionation based upon digestibility, solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the chemical changes occurring during A. gerardii litter decomposition, and (2) compare the information obtained from each method to assess agreement. Overall, we observed a 97 \% mass loss of the original litter, through a two-stage decomposition process. In the first stage, within 12 months, non-structural, cellulose and hemicellulose fractions not encrusted in lignin were preferentially and rapidly lost, while the acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) and microbial components increased. During the second stage, 12-36 months, all wet chemical fraction masses decreased equivalently and slowly with time, and the AUR and the lignin-encrusted cellulose fractions decomposition rates were comparable to each other. Method comparisons revealed that wet chemical fractionation did not accurately follow the initial litter structures, particularly lignin, likely because of chemical transformations and accumulation of microbial biomass. FTIR and NMR were able to determine bulk structural characteristics, and aid in elucidating chemical transformations but lacked the ability to measure absolute quantities of structural groups. As a result, we warn from the sole use of wet chemical methods, and strongly encourage coupling them with spectroscopic methods. Our results overall support the traditional chemical model of selective preservation of lignin, but shows that this is limited to the early stages of decomposition, while lignin is not selectively preserved at subsequent stages. Our study also provides important evidence regarding the impact of chemically different litter structures on decomposition rates and pathways.},

	abstract = {Phenological events, such as bud burst, are strongly linked to ecosystem processes in temperate deciduous forests. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how seasonal and interannual variation in air temperatures influence phenology is poorly understood, and model-based phenology representations fail to capture local- to regional-scale variability arising from differences in species composition. In this paper, we use a combination of surface meteorological data, species composition maps, remote sensing, and ground-based observations to estimate models that better represent how community-level species composition affects the phenological response of deciduous broadleaf forests to climate forcing at spatial scales that are typically used in ecosystem models. Using time series of canopy greenness from repeat digital photography, citizen science data from the USA National Phenology Network, and satellite remote sensing-based observations of phenology, we estimated and tested models that predict the timing of spring leaf emergence across five different deciduous broadleaf forest types in the eastern United States. Specifically, we evaluated two different approaches: (i) using species-specific models in combination with species composition information to upscale' model predictions and (ii) using repeat digital photography of forest canopies that observe and integrate the phenological behavior of multiple representative species at each camera site to calibrate a single model for all deciduous broadleaf forests. Our results demonstrate variability in cumulative forcing requirements and photoperiod cues across species and forest types, and show how community composition influences phenological dynamics over large areas. At the same time, the response of different species to spatial and interannual variation in weather is, under the current climate regime, sufficiently similar that the generic deciduous forest model based on repeat digital photography performed comparably to the upscaled species-specific models. More generally, results from this analysis demonstrate how insitu observation networks and remote sensing data can be used to synergistically calibrate and assess regional parameterizations of phenology in models.},

	abstract = {The novel ecosystems concept has gained much traction in the restoration community. It has also drawn the ire of several prominent ecologists and is the focus of an ongoing debate. We consider three key aspects of this debate: irreversible thresholds, non-native species, and the hybrid state. Irreversible thresholds have been acknowledged in restoration for years, but predicting when a threshold will be crossed and the degree of reversibility is problematic. Oftentimes reversibility is a function of multiple factors, such as cost and public support. In this sense, a novel ecosystem is not an alternate state but a decision. The need for pragmatism regarding control of non-natives has also long been recognized in restoration circles. Proponents of the novel ecosystem idea adopt this pragmatism by recommending that management decisions be based on impacts conferred by species in altered ecosystems, regardless of their origin. The concept of a hybrid state has proven difficult to operationalize. We suggest that rather than trying to identify the boundary between hybrid and novel states, ecosystems exist on a gradient of alteration. We offer a decision tree for restoration action that integrates aspects of novel ecosystems with other perspectives in modern restoration ecology. We conclude that the idea of novel ecosystems, though not perfect, deserves a place under the big tent of restoration that includes efforts to return fully to a reference state, as well as strategies for reinstating lost ecological processes and enhancing ecosystem services in transformed landscapes where such a return is deemed infeasible.},

	abstract = {The distribution of forest cover exerts strong controls on the spatiotemporal distribution of snow accumulation and snowmelt. The physical processes that govern these controls are poorly understood given a lack of detailed measurements of snow states. In this study, we address one of many measurement gaps by using contact spectroscopy to measure snow optical grain size at high spatial resolution in trenches dug between tree boles in a subalpine forest. Trenches were collocated with continuous measurements of snow depth and vertical profiles of snow temperature and supplemented with manual measurements of snow temperature, geometric grain size, grain type, and density from trench walls. There was a distinct difference in snow optical grain size between winter and spring periods. In winter and early spring, when facetted snow crystal types were dominant, snow optical grain size was 6\% larger in canopy gaps versus under canopy positions; a difference that was smaller than the measurement uncertainty. By midspring, the magnitude of snow optical grain size differences increased dramatically and patterns of snow optical grain size became highly directional with 34\% larger snow grains in areas south versus north of trees. In winter, snow temperature gradients were up to 5-15 degrees C m(-1) greater under the canopy due to shallower snow accumulation. However, in canopy gaps, snow depths were greater in fall and early winter and therefore more significant kinetic growth metamorphism occurred relative to under canopy positions, resulting in larger snow grains in canopy gaps. Our findings illustrate the novelty of our method of measuring snow optical grain size, allowing for future studies to advance the understanding of how forest and meteorological conditions interact to impact snowpack evolution.},

However, it remains unclear whether increased responses occur in wetter than average years, even in low fertility and low rainfall regions. Location: Four Australian grasslands, including sites in arid Western Australia, semi-arid Victoria, alpine Victoria and sub-tropical Queensland. Methods: Using identical nutrient addition experiments, we use 6-years of biomass, cover and species richness data to examine how rates of biomass production and native and exotic cover and richness are affected by growing season precipitation [proportion of yearly growing season precipitation (GSP) to long-term mean GSP] and nutrient (N, P, K and micronutrients) addition. Results: Rates of grassland productivity strongly increased with increasing GSP. GSP increased rates of native cover but not native or exotic richness, nor rates of exotic cover change. We detected no significant NPK effect on rates of grassland productivity, exotic cover or exotic richness change. In contrast, NPK addition decreased rates of native cover change and fertilized plots had significantly fewer native species. We did not detect a significant interaction between NPK and GSP. Conclusions: Grassland productivity was more strongly predicted by variation in growing season precipitation than by nutrient addition, suggesting it will vary with future changes in rainfall. Response to nutrients, however, depend on species origin, suggesting that increasing soil nutrient availability due to anthropogenic activities is likely to lead to negative effects on native species richness and cover.},

	abstract = {The boreal forest of Alaska has experienced a small area of forest cuttings, amounting to 7137 ha out of a total of 256,284 ha of timberland in the Fairbanks and Kantishna area of state forest land. Low product values and high costs for management have resulted in a low-input type management with heavy reliance on natural regeneration. Because of increasing demand for wood biomass energy which may reduce rotation ages, understanding post-harvest regeneration is crucial. Harvested areas must meet stocking standards within seven years under the state Forest Resources \& Practices Act (FRPA). We evaluated whether state forest harvest units are adequately regenerated, up to 40 years following harvest based on FRPA standards in terms of stem density and biomass accumulation. We measured density of all tree size classes, and DBH and height of tree species in 726 plots from 30 representative harvest units, distributed according to harvest and treatment types, harvest year, unit size, and the geographical location of harvests. The majority of regenerated tree stems came from natural regeneration, even on planted units (77\%). White spruce (Picea glauca) natural regeneration appears to continue for a few decades (seed crops) following harvest. Stem density was below the standard in most units surveyed during the FRPA 7-year period, but far exceeded the standard when resampled in this study (average 16 years later), suggesting either seven years is too early to evaluate tree regeneration, or that a different standard is needed for early surveys. We found a major peak in white spruce stem density (45,000 ha(-1)) in units harvested in 1987 (an historically large spruce seed crop year), suggesting that where possible, foresters need to adjust management plans according to spruce mast years. Post-harvest and post-fire successional patterns are similar; involving rapid establishment and growth of hardwoods and slow growth of white spruce, but post-harvest white spruce recruitment appears to continue longer than post-fire. By 2014 all measured harvest units met FRPA standard under low-input management, but some issues of uniformity of regeneration may remain. Although regeneration density varied among species and by management practices, biomass accumulated steadily over time (60 t ha(-1) after 40 years), largely composed of hardwoods, indicating that short-rotation forest management must utilize hardwoods. Our results are based on relatively small harvest units within a matrix of natural forest, and similar results might not occur in landscapes dominated by stands originated from more extensive and intensive management.

Chronic nitrogen (N) amendments frequently cause the accumulation of soil organic matter within soils, suggesting that elevated N disrupts decomposition by altering fungal communities: To link previously observed increases in soil organic matter with potential changes in the fungal community, we assessed the effects of soil N amendment on fungal community structure at a long-term N addition experiment at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA, USA). A decline in the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi following long-term N addition was offset by an increase in the relative abundance of saprotrophs. Species richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined, while ascomycetes and saprotrophs responded positively to N enrichment. However, nitrophilic species included ectomycorrhizal as well as saprotrophic fungi, especially the ectomycorrhizal Russula vinacea, whose relative abundance increased from 10 to 37\% of the entire community across N treatments. Two decades of soil N enrichment appears to have fundamentally altered the soil fungal community of this temperate forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Treated wastewater on average contributed over 90\% of the instream dissolved inorganic nutrients (101 kg/day NH4-N, 1097 kg/day NO3-N, 656 kg/day SRP). During growing seasons, the irrigation network downstream of wastewater outfalls retained on average 37\% of NO3-N and 45\% of SRP inputs, with maximum retention exceeding 60\% and 80\% of NO3-N and SRP inputs, respectively. Accurate quantification of NH4-N retention was hindered by low loading and high variability. Nutrient retention in the irrigation network and instream processes together limited downstream export during growing seasons, with total retention of 33-99\% of NO3-N inputs and 45-99\% of SRP inputs. From our synoptic analysis, we identify trade-offs associated with wastewater reuse for agriculture within the scope of the FEW nexus and propose strategies for closing nutrient loops in arid-land rivers.},

	abstract = {Dormancy is thought to promote biodiversity within microbial communities, but how assembly of the active community responds to changes in environmental conditions is unclear. To measure the active and dormant communities of bacteria and fungi colonizing decomposing litter in maple forests, we targeted ribosomal genes and transcripts across a natural environmental gradient. Within bacterial and fungal communities, the active and dormant communities were phylogenetically distinct, but patterns of phylogenetic clustering varied. For bacteria, active communities were significantly more clustered than dormant communities, while the reverse was found for fungi. The proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as active and the degree of phylogenetic clustering of the active bacterial communities declined with increasing pH and decreasing C/N. No significant correlations were found for the fungal community. The opposing pattern of phylogenetic clustering in dormant and active communities and the differential response of active communities to environmental gradients suggest that dormancy differentially structures bacterial and fungal communities.},

	abstract = {Woody species expansion threatens to transform mesic North American grasslands. In many tallgrass prairies of the central Great Plains with deep soil, Cornus drummondii develops large shrub islands that exhibit non-linear increases in cover through time. Reliance on soil moisture from deeper soil depths facilitates constant gas exchange rates and minimizes competition with coexisting herbaceous species. Conversely, C. drummondii growth and expansion in thinsoil locations is stochastic and these locations are typically free of large shrub islands. At the Konza Prairie in northeast Kansas, USA, we compared the ecohydrology of C. drummondii individuals to a similar-sized forb (Solidago canadensis) in thin-soil locations with varying fire frequency (4-, 20-year) and grazer abundance (bison present or absent). Gas exchange rates were relatively constant for C. drummondii, while S. canadensis declined across the growing season. For S. canadensis, maximum photosynthesis (Amax), daytime transpiration (E), and stomatal conductance (gs) were higher on ungrazed than grazed treatments. Nighttime E rates were higher in C. drummondii, accounting for over 10 \% of the daytime E rates. The water source used did not vary among contrasts, with the majority of water uptake occurring from 30 cm depth for both species. These results highlight a unique ecohydrology of C. drummondii (static water flux, and high rates of nighttime E) compared to a similar-sized, co-occurring forb. Whereas C. drummondii is infrequent in thin-soil locations, the climate conditions occurring during measurements were not a likely filter restricting persistence. Rather, drier conditions or interactions with other grassland disturbances are likely required to restrict C. drummondii encroachment in the thins-soil locations of tallgrass prairie.},

This review considered replacing or augmenting extensive dewatering, anaerobic digestion, and off-site disposal with new thermo-chemical and liquid extraction processes. These technologies may better recover energy and metals while inactivating pathogens and destroying organic pollutants. Because limited direct comparisons between different sludge types exist in the literature for hydrothermal liquefaction, this study augments the findings with experimental data. These experiments demonstrated 50\% reduction in sludge mass, with 30\% of liquefaction products converted to bio-oil and most metals sequestered within a small mass of solid bio-char residue. Finally, each technology's contribution to the three sustainability pillars is investigated. Although limiting hazardous materials reintroduction to the environment may increase economic cost of sludge treatment, it is balanced by cleaner environment and valuable resource benefits for society.

This study quantified C and N processes related to clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) aquaculture in a shallow coastal environment (Cherrystone Inlet, VA) where the industry has rapidly increased. Clam physiological rates were compared with basin-wide ecosystem fluxes including primary production, benthic nutrient regeneration, and respiration. Although clam beds occupy only 3 \% of the ecosystem's surface area, clams filtered 7-44 \% of the system's volume daily, consumed an annual average of 103 \% of the phytoplankton production, creating a large flux of particulate C and N to the sediments. Annually, N regenerated and C respired by clam and microbial metabolism in clam beds were similar to 3- and similar to 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than N and C removed through harvest. Due to the short water residence time, the low watershed load, and the close vicinity of clam beds to the mouth of Cherrystone Inlet, cultivated clams are likely subsidized by phytoplankton from the Chesapeake Bay. Consequently, much of the N released by mineralization associated with clam cultivation is "new" N as it would not be present in the system without bivalve facilitation. Macroalgae that are fueled by the enhanced N regeneration from clams represents a eutrophying process resulting from aquaculture. This synthesis demonstrates the importance of considering impacts of bivalve aquaculture in an ecosystem context especially relative to the potential of bivalves to remove nutrients and enhance C sinks.},

	abstract = {As bivalve aquaculture expands worldwide, an understanding of its role in nutrient cycling is necessary to ensure ecological sustainability and determine the potential of using bivalves for nutrient mitigation. Whereas several studies, primarily of epifaunal bivalves, have assessed denitrification, few have considered nutrient regeneration processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which competes with denitrification for nitrate and results in nitrogen retention rather than loss. This study compares sediment nitrogen cycling including mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification within U.S. clam aquaculture sediments to nearby uncultivated sediments, seasonally. Clam aquaculture significantly increased sediment ammonium and phosphate effluxes relative to uncultivated sediments. Both DNRA and denitrification were significantly enhanced at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments in July and November, while in May only DNRA was increased. The ratio of DNRA to denitrification was significantly higher at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments, demonstrating that DNRA may be favored due to a ready supply of labile organic carbon relative to nitrate and perhaps sulfidic conditions. Functional gene abundances, nrfA (DNRA) and nirS (denitrification) followed similar patterns to nitrate respiration rates with highest nrfA abundances in the clam sediments and similar nirS abundances across seasons and sediment type. Ultimately clam sediments were found to be a significant source of nutrients to the water column whereas uncultivated sediments retained ammonium produced by microbial mineralization. Thus, clam cultivation may promote local eutrophication (i.e., increased primary production) by facilitating nutrient regeneration and retention of ammonium in the sediments.},

Permanent plot data collected in the pasture over the first 10 years after abandonment were used to generate linear regressions, which were then used to test two hypotheses about how productivity and richness relate to turnover, as this pasture reverts back to rainforest. I found (1) productivity had a slight positive relationship (small positive slope) with turnover in years two and three after abandonment, but a large negative relationship (large negative slope) in year four and afterwards, and (2) richness had a negative relationship with turnover in every year which increased (slope became more negative) with time. Because both productivity and richness had a negative relationship with turnover, species loss decreased with time even when species productivity and richness continued to increase or level off; turnover consists mainly in the loss of less productive species. I suggest restoration strategies that managers may follow to either increase or decrease that most basic successional parameter, turnover.},

	abstract = {Quantifying rates of microbial carbon transformation in peatlands is essential for gaining mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence methane emissions from these systems, and for predicting how emissions will respond to climate change and other disturbances. In this study, we used porewater stable isotopes collected from both the edge and center of a thermokarst bog in Interior Alaska to estimate in situ microbial reaction rates. We expected that near the edge of the thaw feature, actively thawing permafrost and greater abundance of sedges would increase carbon, oxygen and nutrient availability, enabling faster microbial rates relative to the center of the thaw feature. We developed three different conceptual reaction networks that explained the temporal change in porewater CO2, CH4, delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-CH4. All three reaction-network models included methane production, methane oxidation and CO2 production, and two of the models included homoacetogenesis-a reaction not previously included in isotope-based porewater models. All three models fit the data equally well, but rates resulting from the models differed. Most notably, inclusion of homoacetogenesis altered the modeled pathways of methane production when the reaction was directly coupled to methanogenesis, and it decreased gross methane production rates by up to a factor of five when it remained decoupled from methanogenesis. The ability of all three conceptual reaction networks to successfully match the measured data indicate that this technique for estimating in situ reaction rates requires other data and information from the site to confirm the considered set of microbial reactions. Despite these differences, all models indicated that, as expected, rates were greater at the edge than in the center of the thaw bog, that rates at the edge increased more during the growing season than did rates in the center, and that the ratio of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greater at the edge than in the center. In both locations, modeled rates (excluding methane oxidation) increased with depth. A puzzling outcome from the effort was that none of the models could fit the porewater dataset without generating "fugitive" carbon (i.e., methane or acetate generated by the models but not detected at the field site), indicating that either our conceptualization of the reactions occurring at the site remains incomplete or our site measurements are missing important carbon transformations and/or carbon fluxes. This model-data discrepancy will motivate and inform future research efforts focused on improving our understanding of carbon cycling in permafrost wetlands.},

We analyze the household response to a hypothetical rebate program to incentivize rain garden adoption using household survey data from the Baltimore-Washington corridor. We asked respondents whether the household would adopt a rain garden without a rebate or when offered a randomly assigned rebate. An interval-data model is used to estimate household demand on the willingness to pay (WTP) for a rain garden as a function of demographic factors, gardening activities, environmental attitudes, and other household characteristics. Estimation results indicate that mean WTP for a rain garden in our sample population is approximately \$6.72 per square foot, corresponding to almost three-fourths of the installation cost. The expected adoption rate more than tripled when comparing no rebate versus a government rebate set at one-third of the installation cost, indicating that economic incentives matter. There is substantial heterogeneity in the WTP among households. Higher levels of WTP are estimated for households with higher environmental concern for the Chesapeake Bay and local streams, garden experience, higher income, and non-senior citizen adults. We conclude that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for local governments to meet water quality requirements.},

	abstract = {The core component of many hydrological systems, the moisture storage capacity available to vegetation, is impossible to observe directly at the catchment scale and is typically treated as a calibration parameter or obtained from a priori available soil characteristics combined with estimates of rooting depth. Often this parameter is considered to remain constant in time. Using long-term data (30-40 years) from three experimental catchments that underwent significant land cover change, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) the root-zone storage capacity significantly changes after deforestation, (2) changes in the root-zone storage capacity can to a large extent explain post-treatment changes to the hydrological regimes and that (3) a time-dynamic formulation of the root-zone storage can improve the performance of a hydrological model. A recently introduced method to estimate catchment-scale root-zone storage capacities based on climate data (i.e. observed rainfall and an estimate of transpiration) was used to reproduce the temporal evolution of root-zone storage capacity under change. Briefly, the maximum deficit that arises from the difference between cumulative daily precipitation and transpiration can be considered as a proxy for root-zone storage capacity. This value was compared to the value obtained from four different conceptual hydrological models that were calibrated for consecutive 2-year windows. It was found that water-balance-derived root-zone storage capacities were similar to the values obtained from calibration of the hydrological models. A sharp decline in root-zone storage capacity was observed after deforestation, followed by a gradual recovery, for two of the three catchments. Trend analysis suggested hydrological recovery periods between 5 and 13 years after deforestation. In a proof-of-concept analysis, one of the hydrological models was adapted to allow dynamically changing root-zone storage capacities, following the observed changes due to deforestation. Although the overall performance of the modified model did not considerably change, in 51\% of all the evaluated hydrological signatures, considering all three catchments, improvements were observed when adding a time-variant representation of the root-zone storage to the model. In summary, it is shown that root-zone moisture storage capacities can be highly affected by deforestation and climatic influences and that a simple method exclusively based on climate data can not only provide robust, catchment-scale estimates of this critical parameter, but also reflect its time-dynamic behaviour after deforestation.},

	abstract = {In mountainous areas, cold air drainage from high to low elevations has pronounced effects on local temperature, which is a critical driver of many ecosystem processes, including carbon uptake and storage. Here, we leverage new approaches for interpreting ecosystem carbon flux observations in complex terrain to quantify the links between macro-climate condition, drainage flows, local microclimate, and ecosystem carbon cycling in a southern Appalachian valley. Data from multiple long-running climate stations and multiple eddy covariance flux towers are combined with simple models for ecosystem carbon fluxes. We show that cold air drainage into the valley suppresses local temperature by several degrees at night and for several hours before and after sunset, leading to reductions in growing season respiration on the order of similar to 8\%. As a result, we estimate that drainage flows increase growing season and annual net carbon uptake in the valley by {\textgreater}10\% and {\textgreater}15\%, respectively, via effects on microclimate that are not be adequately represented in regional- and global-scale terrestrial ecosystem models. Analyses driven by chamber-based estimates of soil and plant respiration reveal cold air drainage effects on ecosystem respiration are dominated by reductions to the respiration of aboveground biomass. We further show that cold air drainage proceeds more readily when cloud cover and humidity are low, resulting in the greatest enhancements to net carbon uptake in the valley under clear, cloud-free (i.e., drought-like) conditions. This is a counterintuitive result that is neither observed nor predicted outside of the valley, where nocturnal temperature and respiration increase during dry periods. This result should motivate efforts to explore how topographic flows may buffer eco-physiological processes from macroscale climate change.},

During crop establishment, disruptive land-use change is known to be a critical, but under reported period, for determining GHG emissions. We measured soil N2O emissions and potential environmental drivers of these fluxes from a three-year establishment-phase bioenergy cropping systems experiment replicated in southcentral Wisconsin (ARL) and southwestern Michigan (KBS). Cropping systems treatments were annual monocultures (continuous corn, corn-soybean-canola rotation), perennial monocultures (switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar), and perennial polycultures (native grass mixture, early successional community, and restored prairie) all grown using best management practices specific to the system. Cumulative three-year N2O emissions from annuals were 142\% higher than from perennials, with fertilized perennials 190\% higher than unfertilized perennials. Emissions ranged from 3.1 to 19.1kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the annuals with continuous corn {\textgreater} corn-soybean-canola rotation and 1.1 to 6.3kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for perennials. Nitrous oxide peak fluxes typically were associated with precipitation events that closely followed fertilization. Bayesian modeling of N2O fluxes based on measured environmental factors explained 33\% of variability across all systems. Models trained on single systems performed well in most monocultures (e.g., R-2=0.52 for poplar) but notably worse in polycultures (e.g., R-2=0.17 for early successional, R-2=0.06 for restored prairie), indicating that simulation models that include N2O emissions should be parameterized specific to particular plant communities. Our results indicate that perennial bioenergy crops in their establishment phase emit less N2O than annual crops, especially when not fertilized. These findings should be considered further alongside yield and other metrics contributing to important ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Polar regions are warming more rapidly than lower latitudes, and climate models predict that this trend will continue into the coming decades. Despite these observations and predictions, relatively little is known about how polar ecosystems have responded and will continue to respond to this change. Two Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites, located in contrasting environments in Antarctica, have been studying marine and aquatic terrestrial ecosystems for more than two decades. We use data from these research areas to show that the extent and thickness of ice covers are highly sensitive to short- and long-term climate variation and that this variation significantly influences ecosystem processes in these respective environments. Declining sea-ice extent and duration diminishes phytoplankton blooms as a consequence of reduced water stratification, whereas the thinning of lake-ice cover enhances phytoplankton blooms because of increased penetrating light into the water column. Both responses have cascading effects on upper trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Competition among gametes for fertilization imposes strong selection. For external fertilizers, this selective pressure extends to eggs for which spawning conditions can range from sperm limitation (competition among eggs) to sexual conflict (overabundance of competing sperm toxic to eggs). Yet existing fertilization models ignore dynamics that can alter the functional nature of gamete interactions. These factors include attraction of sperm to eggs, egg crowding effects, or other nonlinearities in per capita rates of sperm-egg interaction. Such processes potentially allow egg concentrations to drastically affect viable fertilization probabilities. I experimentally tested whether such egg effects occur, using the urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and parameterized a newly derived model of fertilization dynamics and existing models modified to include such interactions. The experiments revealed that at low sperm concentrations, eggs compete for sperm, while at high sperm concentrations, eggs cooperatively reduce abnormal fertilization (a proxy for polyspermy). I show that these observations are consistent with declines in the per capita rate at which sperm and eggs interact as eggs increase in density. The results suggest a fitness trade-off of egg release during spawning: as sperm range from scarce to superabundant, interactions among eggs transition from highly competitive to cooperative in terms of viable fertilization probabilities.},

	abstract = {Planktonic foraminiferal calcification intensity, reflected by shell wall thickness, has been hypothesized to covary with the carbonate chemistry of seawater. Here we use both sediment trap and box core samples from the Santa Barbara Basin to evaluate the relationship between the calcification intensity of the planktonic foraminifera species Globigerina bulloides, measured by area density (mu g/mu m(2)), and the carbonate ion concentration of seawater ([CO32-]). We also evaluate the influence of both temperature and nutrient concentration ([PO43-]) on foraminiferal calcification and growth. The presence of two G.bulloides morphospecies with systematically different calcification properties and offset stable isotopic compositions was identified within sampling populations using distinguishing morphometric characteristics. The calcification temperature and by extension calcification depth of the more abundant normal G.bulloides morphospecies was determined using O-18 temperature estimates. Calcification depths vary seasonally with upwelling and were used to select the appropriate [CO32-], temperature, and [PO43-] depth measurements for comparison with area density. Seasonal upwelling in the study region also results in collinearity between independent variables complicating a straightforward statistical analysis. To address this issue, we use additional statistical diagnostics and a down core record to disentangle the respective roles of each parameter on G.bulloides calcification. Our results indicate that [CO32-] is the primary variable controlling calcification intensity while temperature influences shell size. We report a modern calibration for the normal G.bulloides morphospecies that can be used in down core studies of well-preserved sediments to estimate past [CO32-].},

However, auctions only succeed if enough farmers choose to bid so that the auctioneer can evaluate numerous projects for targeted funding. A 2014 conservation auction to allocate payments for practices that reduce phosphorus runoff in Northwest Ohio experienced very thin bidding. According to a follow-up survey, auction participation was deterred by the perceived complexity of the bidding process and the need to negotiate with renters. Due to low participation, the actual conservation auction made payments for phosphorus reduction that were surprisingly costly at the margin. Applying a farmer behavioral model to the Western Lake Erie Basin, we simulate participation choice and cost-effectiveness of environmental outcomes in reverse auctions and uniform payment conservation programs. Results reveal that when perceived transaction costs of bid preparation are high, reverse auctions can be less cost-effective than spatially targeted, uniform payment programs that attract higher participation.},

	abstract = {Cost-effectively mitigating agricultural nutrient export requires an understanding of the biophysical characteristics of cropland as well as the behavioral and economic factors that drive land management decisions. Conservation auctions informed by models that simulate environmental outcomes have the potential to allocate conservation payments cost-effectively by funding practices that provide high predicted environmental benefits per dollar spent. This research tested two forms of conservation auctions. First, experimental auctions were used to analyze farmer preferences for different types of financial incentives for voluntary conservation, including direct payments, insurance, tax credits, and stewardship certification benefits. Second, conservation auctions were conducted in two Ohio counties to evaluate performance under real-world conditions. Supporting both types of auctions, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) predicted reductions in phosphorus exported as a function of the type of conservation practice and farm location. Results of the experimental auctions showed direct payments and tax credits to be the most cost-effective incentives to mitigate phosphorus export. The real auctions yielded two important lessons: 1) participation was very low, due to perceived transaction costs of participation especially on rented fields and for group bids, and 2) the cost-effectiveness ranking of bids was highly sensitive to the parameters for soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in the SWAT model. Future socio-economic research into payment for environmental services programs should seek cost-effective mechanisms with lower transaction costs for participants. Future biophysical research should strengthen our understanding of the factors governing soluble reactive phosphorus movement, so that models like SWAT can be more reliably parameterized.

We use a mixed-method socio-ecological approach to examine how persons experiencing homelessness in Phoenix, Arizona, access ecosystem services and encounter disservices in urban waterways. We find that urban waterways provide users with drinking and bathing water, and cooler, shaded areas, but potentially expose them to pathogens and legal persecution. The wetlands provide cultural services by affording a sense of place and safety; however, these locations can also be associated with restrictive ordinances and aggressive law enforcement. This study explores the role of ecosystem services and disservices in bridging the gap between biophysical and social vulnerability.},

	abstract = {This review covers historical perspectives, the role of plant inputs, and the nature and dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM), often known as humus. Information on turnover of organic matter components, the role of microbial products, and modeling of SOM, and tracer research should help us to anticipate what future research may answer today's challenges. Our globe's most important natural resource is best studied relative to its chemistry, dynamics, matrix interactions, and microbial transformations. Humus has similar, worldwide characteristics, but varies with abiotic controls, soil type, vegetation inputs and composition, and the soil biota. It contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, phenol-aromatics, protein derived and cyclic nitrogenous compounds, and some still unknown compounds. Protection of transformed plant residues and microbial products occurs through spatial inaccessibility-resource availability, aggregation of mineral and organic constituents, and interactions with sesquioxides, cations, silts, and clays. Tracers that became available in the mid-20th century made the study of SOM dynamics possible. Carbon dating identified resistant, often mineral-associated, materials to be thousands of years old, especially at depth in the profile. The C-13 associated with C-3-C-4 plant switches characterized slow turnover pools with ages ranging from dozens to hundreds of years. Added tracers, in conjunction with compound-specific product analysis and incubation, identified active pools with fast turnover rates. Physical fractionations of the intra- and inter-aggregate materials, and those associated with silt and clay, showed that all pools contain both old and young materials. Charcoal is old but not inert. The C:N ratio changes from 25 to 70:1 for plant residues to 6 to 9:1 for soil biota and microbial products associated with soil minerals. Active, slow and passive (resistant) pool concepts have been well used in biogeochemical models. The concepts discussed herein have implications for today's challenges in nutrient cycling, biogeochemistry, soil ecosystem functioning, pollution control, feeding the expanding global population and global change.

	abstract = {An improved understanding of sources and timing of water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes associated with urban infrastructure and stream restoration is critical for guiding effective watershed management globally. We investigated how sources, fluxes, and flowpaths of water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) shift in response to differences in urban stream restoration and sewer infrastructure. We compared an urban restored stream with two urban degraded streams draining varying levels of urban development and one stream with upland stormwater management systems over a 3-year period. We found that there was significantly decreased peak discharge in response to precipitation events following stream restoration. Similarly, we found that the restored stream showed significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) monthly peak runoff (9.4 +/- 1.0mm day(-1)) compared with two urban degraded streams (ranging from 44.9 +/- 4.5 to 55.4 +/- 5.8mm day(-1)) draining higher impervious surface cover, and the stream-draining stormwater management systems and less impervious surface cover in its watershed (13.2 +/- 1.9 mm day(-1)). The restored stream exported most carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus at relatively lower streamflow than the two more urban catchments, which exported most carbon and nutrients at higher streamflow. Annual exports of total carbon (6.6 +/- 0.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), total nitrogen (4.5 +/- 0.3 kg ha(-1) yr (-1)), and total phosphorus (161 +/- 15 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were significantly lower in the restored stream compared to both urban degraded streams (p {\textless} 0.05), but statistically similar to the stream draining stormwater management systems, for N exports. However, nitrate isotope data suggested that 55 +/- 1\% of the nitrate in the urban restored stream was derived from leaky sanitary sewers (during baseflow), statistically similar to the urban degraded streams. These isotopic results as well as additional tracers, including fluoride (added to drinking water) and iodide (contained in dietary salt), suggested that groundwater contamination was a major source of urban nutrient fluxes, which has been less considered compared to upland sources. Overall, leaking sewer pipes are a problem globally and our results suggest that combining stream restoration with restoration of aging sewer pipes can be critical to more effectively minimizing urban nonpoint nutrient sources. The sources, fluxes, and flowpaths of groundwater should be prioritized in management efforts to improve stream restoration by locating hydrologic hot spots where stream restoration is most likely to succeed.},

Despite the importance of grasslands, there is little information on how fine-scale relationships compare between them regionally. We compared grassland C exchanges, energy partitioning and precipitation variability in eight sites in the eastern and western Great Plains using eddy covariance and meteorological data. During our study, both eastern and western grasslands varied between an average net carbon sink and a net source. Eastern grasslands had a moderate vapor pressure deficit (VPD=0.95kPa) and high growing season gross primary productivity (GPP=1010218gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Western grasslands had a growing season with higher VPD (1.43kPa) and lower GPP (360127gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Western grasslands were sensitive to precipitation at daily timescales, whereas eastern grasslands were sensitive at monthly and seasonal timescales. Our results support the expectation that C exchanges in these grasslands differ as a result of varying precipitation regimes. Because eastern grasslands are less influenced by short-term variability in rainfall than western grasslands, the effects of precipitation change are likely to be more predictable in eastern grasslands because the timescales of variability that must be resolved are relatively longer. We postulate increasing regional heterogeneity in grassland C exchanges in the Great Plains in coming decades.},

While organic matter (OM) dynamics in large rivers has been studied in quite some detail, less is known about small streams. Sources of OM in streams ultimately determine its availability to the food web and downstream transport. In this study, sediment samples were collected from the King's Creek watershed in Konza Prairie (Kansas, USA) and analyzed using molecular biomarkers and bulk C-13 stable isotopes with the objective to comparatively assess OM inputs between riparian forest vegetation and watershed grassland to small, intermittent streams. We are interested in the potential influence of woody riparian expansion that has been ongoing at the site. Biomarkers typical of the local C-4 grasses (branched n-alkanes, phytadienes) were more abundant in some of the sediments of the upper reaches. The sediments of the lower reaches contained biomarkers of algae (short-chain aliphatic compounds, C-25:5 highly branched isoprenoid, brassicasterol) and vascular plant-derived material (triterpenols). Degraded OM (triterpene/triterpenol ratio) was found throughout the watershed with no pattern between the upper and lower reaches. Bulk C-13 isotope analysis showed that the upper reaches of the watershed receive significant OM inputs from the C-4 grasses (74-99 \%) while the lower reaches are more strongly influenced by riparian trees (26-27 \%) and algae (21-22 \%). These results suggest that the environmental dynamics of bulk OM and the biomarker composition of small prairie streams are highly complex and likely a function of several factors such as light availability, riparian vegetative composition and density, and varying degrees of OM storage, retention and transport along the river continuum.},

Here, we explore the extent to which modeled biogeochemical responses to changing climate are affected by the selection of the climate downscaling method and training observations used at the montane landscape of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We evaluated three downscaling methods: the delta method (or the change factor method), monthly quantile mapping (Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation, or BCSD), and daily quantile regression (Asynchronous Regional Regression Model, or ARRM). Additionally, we trained outputs from four atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) (CCSM3, HadCM3, PCM, and GFDL-CM2.1) driven by higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) future emissions scenarios on two sets of observations (1/8 degrees resolution grid vs. individual weather station) to generate the high-resolution climate input for the forest biogeochemical model PnET-BGC (eight ensembles of six runs). The choice of downscaling approach and spatial resolution of the observations used to train the downscaling model impacted modeled soil moisture and streamflow, which in turn affected forest growth, net N mineralization, net soil nitrification, and stream chemistry. All three downscaling methods were highly sensitive to the observations used, resulting in projections that were significantly different between station-based and grid-based observations. The choice of downscaling method also slightly affected the results, however not as much as the choice of observations. Using spatially smoothed gridded observations and/or methods that do not resolve sub-monthly shifts in the distribution of temperature and/or precipitation can produce biased results in model applications run at greater temporal and/or spatial resolutions. These results underscore the importance of carefully considering field observations used for training, as well as the downscaling method used to generate climate change projections, for smaller-scale modeling studies. Different sources of variability including selection of AOGCM, emissions scenario, downscaling technique, and data used for training downscaling models, result in a wide range of projected forest ecosystem responses to future climate change.},

	abstract = {There are many nematode species that, following formal description, are seldom mentioned again in the scientific literature. Lobocriconema thornei and L. incrassatum are two such species, described from North American forests, respectively 37 and 49 years ago. In the course of a 3-year nematode biodiversity survey of North American ecoregions, specimens resembling Lobocriconema species appeared in soil samples from both grassland and forested sites. Using a combination of molecular and morphological analyses, together with a set of species delimitation approaches, we have expanded the known range of these species, added to the species descriptions, and discovered a related group of species that form a monophyletic group with the two described species. In this study, 148 specimens potentially belonging to the genus Lobocriconema were isolated from soil, individually measured, digitally imaged, and DNA barcoded using a 721 bp region of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI). One-third of the specimens were also analyzed using amplified DNA from the 3' region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18SrDNA) and the adjacent first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). Eighteen mitochondrial haplotype groups, falling into four major clades, were identified by well-supported nodes in Bayesian and maximum likelihood trees and recognized as distinct lineages by species delimitation metrics. Discriminant function analysis of a set of morphological characters indicated that the major clades in the dataset possessed a strong morphological signal that decreased in comparisons of haplotype groups within clades. Evidence of biogeographic and phylogeographic patterns was apparent in the dataset. COI haplotype diversity was high in the southern Appalachian Mountains and Gulf Coast states and lessened in northern temperate forests. Lobocriconema distribution suggests the existence of phylogeographic patterns associated with recolonization of formerly glaciated regions by eastern deciduous forest, but definitive glacial refugia for this group of plant parasitic nematodes have yet to be identified. Unlike agricultural pest species of plant-parasitic nematodes, there is little evidence of long-distance dispersal in Lobocriconema as revealed by haplotype distribution. Most haplotype groups were characterized by low levels of intragroup genetic variation and large genetic distances between haplotype groups. The localization of nematode haplotypes together with their characteristic plant communities could provide insight into the historical formation of these belowground biotic communities.},

Using a long-term data set on seven alpine lakes (3126 to 3620 m) in Colorado, USA, we show that ice-off dates have shifted 7 days earlier over the past 33 years and that spring weather conditions-especially snowfall-drive yearly variation in ice-off timing. In the most well studied lake, earlier ice-off associated with increases in water residence times, thermal stratification, ion concentrations, dissolved nitrogen, pH, and chlorophyll a. Mechanistically, low spring snowfall and warm temperatures reduce summer stream flow (increasing lake residence times) but enhance melting of glacial and permafrost ice (increasing lake solute inputs). The observed links among hydrological, chemical, and biological responses to climate factors highlight the potential for major shifts in the functioning of alpine lakes due to forecasted climate change.},

	abstract = {Old soil carbon (C) respired to the atmosphere as a result of permafrost thaw has the potential to become a large positive feedback to climate change. As permafrost thaws, quantifying old soil contributions to ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and understanding how these contributions change with warming is necessary to estimate the size of this positive feedback. We used naturally occurring C isotopes (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) to partition R-eco into plant, young soil and old soil sources in a subarctic air and soil warming experiment over three years. We found that old soil contributions to R-eco increased with soil temperature and R-eco flux. However, the increase in the soil warming treatment was smaller than expected because experimentally warming the soils increased plant contributions to R-eco by 30\%. On the basis of these data, an increase in mean annual temperature from -5 to 0 degrees C will increase old soil C losses from moist acidic tundra by 35-55 g C m(-2) during the growing season. The largest losses will probably occur where the plant response to warming is minimal.},

	abstract = {The growing need for local climate change scenarios has given rise to a wide range of empirical climate downscaling techniques. One of the most critical decisions in these methodologies is the selection of appropriate predictor variables for the downscaled surface predictand. A systematic approach to selecting predictor variables should be employed to ensure that the most important variables are utilized for the study site where the climate change scenarios are being developed. Tropical study areas have been far less examined than mid- and high-latitudes in the climate downscaling literature. As a result, studies analyzing optimal predictor variables for tropics are limited. The objectives of this study include developing artificial neural networks for six sites around Puerto Rico to develop nonlinear functions between 37 atmospheric predictor variables and local rainfall. The relative importance of each predictor is analyzed to determine the most important inputs in the network. Randomized ANNs are produced to determine the statistical significance of the relative importance of each predictor variable. Lower tropospheric moisture and winds are shown to be the most important variables at all sites. Results show inter-site variability in u- and v-wind importance depending on the unique geographic situation of the site. Lower tropospheric moisture and winds are physically linked to variability in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the strength and position of the North Atlantic High Pressure cell (NAHP). The changes forced by anthropogenic climate change in regional SSTs and the NAHP will impact rainfall variability in Puerto Rico.},

This has been especially problematic for the dynamic and highly productive communities inhabiting shallow reefs in temperate seas where varied metrics are commonly used to characterize the abundance and biomass of different suites of species. To facilitate the conversion of abundance data into common metrics of biomass, we developed quantitative relationships between wet mass and length and wet mass and percent cover, and conversion factors for transforming wet mass into dry mass, shell-free and decalcified dry mass, and ash-free dry mass for 84 species of benthic macroinvertebrates common to giant kelp forests in southern California. Regressions for all 84 species were highly significant, and regression fits were very good for most species. Interspecific differences between regression slopes and in the ratios used to convert one metric of mass into another varied by as much as an order of magnitude among species within the same taxonomic group indicating that caution should be used when attempting to estimate biomass using generic relationships or ratios that were developed for other species, even if those species are closely related.},

Such research is essential for advancing our understanding of ecological responses associated with climate change, and the physical and biological processes that control them. This need is perhaps greatest for ecosystems that display highly dynamic and spatially complex patterns that are difficult to explain with short-term, small-scale studies. Such is the case for kelp forest ecosystems, which often show tremendous spatial and temporal variability in resource supply, consumer control and physical disturbance across spatial scales of metres to hundreds of kilometres and temporal scales of hours to decades.

Nesting success for all three species was greatest within areas of vacant lots with high shrub densities. The robins' body condition index did not vary extensively and was not related to any vacant lot site-or landscape-level variables. Even so, we found vacant lots to be actively used by 60 bird species for a variety of resources, with those containing more shrubs to be the most beneficial for bird species' nesting attempts. Vacant lots should no longer be discarded and underestimated; instead, they should be valued for the opportunities they provide for generalist bird species through small-effort habitat management practices.},

	abstract = {Extreme climate events can interact synergistically with invasions to dramatically alter ecosystem structure, function, and services. Yet, the effects of extreme climate events on species invasions remain unresolved. Extreme climate events may increase resources and decrease biotic resistance by causing physiological stress and/or mortality of native taxa, resulting in invasion opportunities for nonnative species. Alternatively, extreme climate events may regulate nonnative populations, preventing them from achieving dominance. We examined whether a sequence of three cold spells had a negative or positive effect on fish invasions in the coastal Everglades. We compared resistance (initial effects) and resilience (rate of recovery) to the cold spells between native fishes and the dominant nonnative invader, the Mayan cichlid, across eight populations expanding two mangroves drainages in the southern Everglades. We tracked native fish and nonnative Mayan cichlid populations for 10 yr including 3 yr pre- and 4 yr post-cold spells. In both drainages, native fishes were more resistant to the cold spells than the nonnative species. While native fishes experienced declines at only one site, nonnative Mayan numbers were reduced by 90-100\% across six sites where they were abundant pre-disturbances. Four years after the last cold spell, we saw limited resilience in the affected nonnative populations. Only one of the six affected sites fully recovered, whereas the other five sites showed no recovery in Mayan cichlid numbers. The recovered site was closest to a canal, known to act as thermal refuges for nonnative fishes. In summary, cold spells can reduce nonnative abundances, but whether cold spells can effectively knock back invasions (and range expansions) by tropical/subtropical nonnative species will depend on how the frequency and severity of cold spells are affected by climate change. We propose that these mortality-causing extreme events could provide rare management opportunities late in an invasion.},

Comparisons of specific N transformations across ecosystems are required to contextualize rates from individual studies. Here we reviewed urban N cycling in terrestrial, aquatic and engineered ecosystems, and compared N processing in these urban ecosystem types to native reference ecosystems. We found that net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were enhanced in urban forests and riparian zones relative to reference ecosystems. Denitrification was highly variable across urban ecosystem types, but no significant differences were found between urban and reference denitrification rates. When focusing on urban streams, ammonium uptake was more rapid than nitrate uptake in urban streams. Additionally, reduction of stormwater runoff coupled with potential decreases in N concentration suggests that green infrastructure may reduce downstream N export. Despite multiple environmental stressors in urban environments, ecosystems within urban watersheds can process and transform N at rates similar to or higher than reference ecosystems.},

We estimated, as of 2010, that this restoration removes 170 ton of nitrogen per year via denitrificiation and sequesters carbon at a rate of 630 tons carbon per year in the sediment. Further, we estimated that natural recovery would take more than 100 years to reach the areal coverage achieved by restoration using seeds in just 10 years. Restoration enhanced this recovery, and the earlier establishment of plants results in a net gain of at least 4,100 ton of nitrogen removed from the system via denitrification and 15,000 ton of carbon sequestered in the sediment.

Although predictions from theoretical models support these findings, the mechanisms that drive this response remain unclear. To address this uncertainty, we sampled soils of three grassland sites in the U.S. Central Great Plains that each have received seven years of continuous experimental nutrient addition in the field. Nitrogen addition significantly decreased the decomposition rate of slowly cycling SOM and the cumulative carbon (C) respired per mass soil C. We evaluated whether this effect of N addition on microbial respiration resulted from: 1) increased microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), 2) decreased microbial oxidative enzyme activity, or 3) decreased microbial biomass due to plant and/or soil mediated responses to N enrichment. In contrast to our hypotheses - as well as results from N addition studies in forest ecosystems and theoretical predictions - N did not increase microbial CUE or decrease microbial oxidative enzyme activity. Instead, reduced microbial biomass likely caused the decreased respiration in response to N enrichment. Identifying what factors drive this decreased microbial biomass response to N should be a priority for further inquiry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, we lack information regarding how relatedness is linked to changes in behavior and the degree of harm that brood parasites cause to their hosts (i.e., virulence). The kin competition hypothesis combines theory from offspring signaling and parasite virulence models and states that the begging intensity of co-infecting parasites is driven by their relatedness, with concomitant changes in the degree of virulence expressed by parasitic young. We tested this hypothesis using the Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater, an obligate brood parasitic bird whose virulence at the nestling stage is mediated by vigorous begging displays that are used to outcompete host young during feeding bouts. We found support for both predictions of the kin competition hypothesis: first, the begging intensity of cowbirds was greater in a population where cowbirds typically competed against unrelated host nestmates, relative to a population where they often competed against kin. Second, the greater intensity of begging in cowbirds was positively associated with decreased growth in host offspring during the developmental period. Given the dearth of studies on virulence in avian brood parasites, our results notably extend our understanding of how relatedness is linked to parasite behavior and virulence, and they highlight how spatially-isolated host populations can harbor different levels of virulence that are driven by competitive interactions between co-infecting parasites.},

	abstract = {To better understand the impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, an important ongoing research priority for marine scientists is to characterize present-day pH variability. Following recent technological advances, autonomous pH sensor deployments in shallow coastal marine environments have revealed that pH dynamics in coastal oceans are more variable in space and time than the discrete, open-ocean measurements that are used for ocean acidification projections. Data from these types of deployments will benefit the research community by facilitating the improved design of ocean acidification studies as well as the identification or evaluation of natural and human-influenced pH variability. Importantly, the collection of ecologically relevant pH data and a cohesive, user-friendly integration of results across sites and regions requires (1) effective sensor operation to ensure high quality pH data collection and (2) efficient data management for accessibility and broad reuse by the marine science community. Here, we review the best practices for deployment, calibration, and data processing and quality control, using our experience with Durafet (R)-based pH sensors as a model. Next, we describe information management practices for streamlining preservation and distribution of data and for cataloging different types of pH sensor data, developed in collaboration with two U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Finally, we assess sensor performance and data recovery from 73 SeaFET deployments in the Santa Barbara Channel using our quality control guidelines and data management tools, and offer recommendations for improved data yields. Our experience provides a template for other groups contemplating using SeaFET technology as well as general steps that may be helpful for the design of data management for other complex sensors.

	abstract = {The turnover of plant biomass largely determines the amount of energy flowing through an ecosystem and understanding the processes that regulate turnover has been of interest to ecologists for decades. Leaf life span theory has proven useful in explaining patterns of leaf turnover in relation to resource availability, but the predictions of this theory have not been tested for macroalgae. We measured blade life span, size, thickness, nitrogen content, pigment content, and maximum photosynthetic rate (P (max)) in the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) along a strong resource (light) gradient to test whether the predictions of leaf life span theory applied to this alga. We found that shorter blade life spans and larger blade areas were associated with increased light availability. In addition, nitrogen and P (max) decreased with blade age, and their decrease was greater in shorter lived blades. These observations are generally consistent with patterns observed for higher plants and the prevailing theory of leaf life span. By contrast, variation observed in pigments of giant kelp was inconsistent with that predicted by leaf life span theory, as blades growing in the most heavily shaded portion of the forest had the lowest chlorophyll content. This result may reflect the dual role of macroalgal blades in carbon fixation and nutrient absorption and the ability of giant kelp to modify blade physiology to optimize the acquisition of light and nutrients. Thus, the marine environment may place demands on resource acquisition and allocation that have not been previously considered with respect to leaf life span optimization.},

	abstract = {The potential for rapid reproduction is a hallmark of microbial life, but microbes in nature must also survive and compete when growth is constrained by resource availability. Successful reproduction requires different strategies when resources are scarce and when they are abundant(1,2), but a systematic framework for predicting these reproductive strategies in bacteria has not been available. Here, we show that the number of ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) in bacterial genomes predicts two important components of reproduction-growth rate and growth efficiency-which are favoured under contrasting regimes of resource availability(3,4). We find that the maximum reproductive rate of bacteria doubles with a doubling of rrn copy number, and the efficiency of carbon use is inversely related to maximal growth rate and rrn copy number. We also identify a feasible explanation for these patterns: the rate and yield of protein synthesis mirror the overall pattern in maximum growth rate and growth efficiency. Furthermore, comparative analysis of genomes from 1,167 bacterial species reveals that rrn copy number predicts traits associated with resource availability, including chemotaxis and genome streamlining. Genome-wide patterns of orthologous gene content covary with rrn copy number, suggesting convergent evolution in response to resource availability. Our findings imply that basic cellular processes adapt in contrasting ways to long-term differences in resource availability. They also establish a basis for predicting changes in bacterial community composition in response to resource perturbations using rrn copy number measurements(5) or inferences(6,7).},

	abstract = {Characterizing the dispersion and dilution of storm water from small coastal creeks is important for understanding the importance of land-derived subsidies to nearby ecosystems and the management of anthropogenic pollutants. In Southern California, creek runoff is episodic, intense, and short-lived while the plumes are buoyant, all of which make the field sampling of freshwater plumes challenging. Numerical modeling offers a viable way to characterize these systems. The dilution and dispersion of freshwater from two creeks that discharge into the Santa Barbara Channel, California is investigated using Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations with a horizontal resolution of 100 m. Tight coupling is found among precipitation, hydrologic discharge, wind forcing, and submesoscale flow structures which all contribute to plume evolution. During flooding, plumes are narrow and attached to the coast, due to downwelling/onshore wind forcing and intense vorticity filaments lying parallel to the shelf. As the storm passes, the winds typically shift to offshore/upwelling favorable conditions and the plume is advected offshore which enhances its dilution. Plumes reach the bottom nearshore while they form thin layers a few meters thick offshore. Dilution field of passive tracers released with the runoff is strongly anisotropic with stronger crossshelf gradients than along-shelf. Dispersion analysis of statistical moments of the passive tracer distribution results in scale-dependent diffusivities consistent with the particle-pair analysis of Romero et al. (2013). Model validation, the roles of submesoscale processes, and wind forcing on plume evolution and application to ecological issues and marine resource management are discussed.},

We hypothesized that higher tidal amplitudes, river discharge, temperature, direct rainfall and decreased potential evapotranspiration explain observed high mangrove AGB. LocationNeotropics and a small portion of the Nearctic region. MethodsA universal forest model based on site-level forest structure statistics was validated to spatially interpolate estimates of mangrove biomass at different locations. Linear models were then used to predict mangrove AGB across the Neotropics. ResultsThe universal forest site-level model was effective in estimating mangrove AGB using pre-existing mangrove forest structure inventories to validate the model. We confirmed our hypothesis that at continental scales higher tidal amplitudes contributed to high forest biomass associated with high temperature and rainfall, and low potential evapotranspiration. Our model explained 20\% of the spatial variability in mangrove AGB, with values ranging from 16.6 to 627.0t ha(-1) (mean, 88.7t ha(-1)). Our findings show that mangrove AGB has been overestimated by 25-50\% in the Neotropics, underscoring a commensurate bias in current published global estimates using site-level information. Main conclusionsOur analysis show how the ESH significantly explains spatial variability in mangrove AGB at hemispheric scales. This finding is critical to improve and explain site-level estimates of mangrove AGB that are currently used to determine the relative contribution of mangrove wetlands to global carbon budgets. Due to the lack of a conceptual framework explicitly linking environmental drivers and mangrove AGB values during model validation, previous works have significantly overestimated mangrove AGB; our novel approach improved these assessments. In addition, our framework can potentially be applied to other forest-dominated ecosystems by allowing the retrieval of extensive databases at local levels to generate more robust statistical predictive models to estimate continental-scale biomass values.},

Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is commonly recommended to stimulate yields but can increase losses of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and other forms of reactive N, including nitrate. We measured soil N2O emissions and nitrate leaching along a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) high resolution N-fertilizer gradient for three years post-establishment. Results revealed an exponential increase in annual N2O emissions that each year became stronger (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.9, P {\textless} 0.001) and deviated further from the fixed percentage assumed for IPCC Tier 1 emission factors. Concomitantly, switchgrass yields became less responsive each year to N fertilizer. Nitrate leaching (and calculated indirect N2O emissions) also increased exponentially in response to N inputs, but neither methane (CH4) uptake nor soil organic carbon changed detectably. Overall, N fertilizer inputs at rates greater than crop need curtailed the climate benefit of ethanol production almost two-fold, from a maximum mitigation capacity of -5.71 +/- 0.22 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) in switchgrass fertilized at 56 kg N ha(-1) to only -2.97 +/- 0.18 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) in switchgrass fertilized at 196 kg N ha(-1).

	abstract = {Prediction of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems is limited by the complexity of the couplings between biosphere and atmosphere-what we define here as eco-climate. Critical transitions in ecosystem function and structure must be conceptualized, modeled, and ultimately predicted. Eco-climate system macrostate is a pattern of physical couplings between subsystems; each macrostate must be modeled differently because different physical processes are important. Critical transitions are less likely where the elasticity of macrostate is weak or absent. This motivates a fundamentally new complex systems approach. To model eco-climate macrostate, and its elasticity to seasonal climate forcing (air temperature and precipitation) and ecosystem biophysical state (phenophase). This Dynamical Process Network approach uses information flow to model an eco-climate system structure using timeseries observations from seven eddy-covariance tower sites in the United States. An aggregate power-law model estimates the elasticity of each location's macrostate to seasonal climate and phenophase. Macrostate varies by both season and ecosystem type. Evergreen forests are highly elastic to air temperature and are more likely than agricultural or deciduous systems to experience state changes as the climate warms. Precipitation and phenophase elasticity is stronger in some agricultural, grassland, and deciduous forest systems. Different empirical model structures are needed based on season and location, to simulate ecosystem carbon dynamics and critical state transitions. Phenophase directly controls macrostate in some ecosystems. Flux data co-located with in situ ecological monitoring are essential for eco-climate model development and prediction using complex systems approaches.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies show that landscape simplification reduces abundance and diversity of natural enemies in agroecosystems, but its effect on natural pest control remains poorly quantified. Further, natural enemy impacts on pest populations have usually been estimated for a limited number of taxa and have not considered interactions among predator species. In a quantitative synthesis with data collected from several cropping systems in Europe and North America, we analyzed how the level and within-field spatial stability of natural pest control services was related to the simplification of the surrounding landscape. All studies used aphids as a model species and exclusion cages to measure aphid pest control. Landscape simplification was quantified by the proportion of cultivated land within a 1 km radius around each plot. We found a consistent negative effect of landscape simplification on the level of natural pest control, despite interactions among enemies. Average level of pest control was 46\% lower in homogeneous landscapes dominated by cultivated land, as compared with more complex landscapes. Landscape simplification did not affect the amount of positive or negative interactions among ground dwelling and vegetation-dwelling predators, or the within-field stability of pest control. Our synthesis demonstrates that agricultural intensification through landscape simplification has negative effects on the level of natural pest control with important implications for management to maintain and enhance ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Specifically, preserving and restoring semi-natural habitats emerges as a fundamental first step to maintain and enhance pest control services provided by predatory arthropods to agriculture.

We examined ground temperatures in the sun and shade, and daily rainfall, within each treatment, during lizard activity periods, to address how lizards used sun or shade microhabitats on a daily basis. Our small-scale rainfall and temperature measurements indicate that rainfall, not temperatures, predict lizard microhabitat use. 4. Lizards showed a strong preference for shaded microhabitats during dry periods and used sunny microhabitats following rainfall events, regardless of treatment type. Lizards remained active during dry periods, foraging in the shade of trees. 5. Our study shows that rainfall can influence lizard microhabitat use more than temperature in a pinon pine-juniper woodland and the trees provide important refugia.

In contrast, four panfish species (i.e., Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, Green L. cyanellus, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, and Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus), which have not received the same conservation management attention, have experienced substantial and sustained erosions in size over the same period.

	abstract = {The boundary between the humid eastern and the arid western regions of the Great Plains of North America is of great economic interest and historic intrigue, yet its location is controversial. Areas to the east of this boundary have historically enjoyed the benefits of fertile soil coupled with more favorable rainfall and reliable surface water, permitting conventional agriculture to flourish over a remarkably large percentage of the eastern Great Plains. The expansion of population and agriculture during the nineteenth century across the western Great Plains tested the extent that non-irrigated, row crop agriculture could be successful in areas where year-to-year rainfall was unreliable. In this paper, we quantify the historic annual variability of soil moisture and hydrologic conditioning in the Great Plains resulting from climatic variability, show the regions that historically demonstrate unreliable precipitation, and identify the extent of arid regions of the central United States based on modeled annual soil moisture variability. We asked how arid climates have influenced soil formation patterns at small cartographic scales, and how soil properties buffer or enhance soil moisture regimes (at the udic-ustic boundary) to climate variability at larger cartographic scales. At small cartographic scales, a climate-only model worked nearly as well as a climate-and-soils model in mapping the region's soil moisture boundary; however, a climate-only model missed important local soil influences. Finally, we demonstrate that long-term climate and climate variability are reflected in the depth and concentration of the calcic soil properties. From a practical standpoint, our work highlights that soils with higher water holding capacity dampen periodic short-term rainfall deficits, while soils with lower water holding capacity can exhibit edaphic drought during otherwise normal climate years.

	abstract = {Constructed treatment wetlands have been well established as effective and sustainable solutions to the problem of urban water treatment and reuse. However, treatment wetlands located in aridland cities may behave differently relative to their more mesic and humid counterparts, and this could potentially impact their ability to deliver the ecosystem services that are expected of them. Specifically, in hot, dry climates large water losses via evaporation and plant transpiration may comprise a major component of whole-system water budgets. Our primary goal was to develop a rigorous and informed model of how well these "working wetlands" function in hot, arid climates by developing and comparing robust water and nutrient budgets, as our process-based understanding of how mesic constructed wetlands function may not be readily transferred to arid climates where constructed wetlands are becoming increasingly widespread. At the Tres Rios constructed treatment wetland in Phoenix AZ USA, we quantified water losses via plant transpiration and open water evaporation as well as inorganic N loads into and from the whole wetland system and into the vegetated marsh. We found that water losses due to transpiration and evaporation were remarkably high when compared to most mesic constructed wetlands. Total water losses via evaporation and transpiration peaked at 300,000 m(3) mo(-1) (714 L H2O m(-2) mo(-1)) in the hot, dry summer months and averaged more than 70\% of the whole-system water losses over a 27 month time period. At the same time, the vegetated marsh removed nearly all of the inorganic N that was supplied to it. Large transpirative water losses moved large volumes of replacement water into the marsh via a "biological tide" that provided more opportunities for vegetation and soil microbes to process N and other target solutes. This enhanced the N treatment efficacy of the Tres Rios constructed treatment wetland relative to humid, mesic systems. To our knowledge, this is the first time that biotically-mediated surface hydrology has been demonstrated in any wetland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Herbivory is thought to be nutritionally inefficient relative to carnivory and omnivory, but herbivory evolved from carnivory in many terrestrial and aquatic lineages, suggesting that there are advantages of eating plants. Herbivory has been well-studied in both terrestrial and aquatic systems, and there is abundant information on feedbacks between herbivores and plants, coevolution of plant and herbivore defenses, mechanisms for mediating nutrient limitation, effects of nutrient limitation on herbivore life history, and, more recently, the origins of the herbivorous diet. Researchers have sufficiently defined the ecological context and evolutionary origins of the herbivorous diet, and these main areas of research have laid the groundwork for studying herbivory as an adaptation. However, we have yet to synthesize this information in a way that allows us to establish a framework of testable adaptive hypotheses. To understand the adaptive significance of this diet transition, we review the current literature and use evidence from these works as support for five hypotheses on the evolution of herbivory from carnivory: (1) intake efficiency-herbivores use part of their food source as habitat, thus minimizing the energy/time spent searching for food and avoiding predators; (2) suboptimal habitat-herbivory allows organisms to invade and establish populations in habitats that have high primary production but low abundance of animal prey; (3) heterotroph facilitation-herbivory is adaptive because herbivores consume microbes associated with producers; (4) lipid allocation-herbivory is adaptive because producers are rich in fatty acids, which fuel reproduction and storage; and (5) disease avoidance-herbivory minimizes animal-facilitated disease transmission. Due to the extensive literature, we have limited this review to discussing herbivory in freshwater systems. To our knowledge, no prior work has compiled a comprehensive list of conditions that favor an herbivorous diet in nature. With backgrounds in both theoretical and experimental ecology, the incorporation of these hypotheses to the current literature will provide information about diet evolution, where it is currently lacking.},

	abstract = {Upstream water diversions have significantly reduced freshwater flow to coastal wetlands of the Everglades. The purpose of this research was to investigate the water balance, flushing time, and water chemistry of Taylor Slough; one of the main natural waterways of the coastal Everglades, during its early stages of restoration. Both the water balance and flushing times were calculated on a monthly basis. from 2001 to 2011. Surface water chemistry was analyzed using 3-day composite samples collected every 18 h. Current restoration efforts have been able to increase surface water inputs to southern Taylor Slough, but rainfall was still the dominant water input. Flushing times varied between 3 and 78 days, with the highest values occurring in December and the lowest in May. Flushing times were negatively correlated with evapotranspiration (ET), but were longer when surface water volume exceeded ET and shorter when ET exceeded water volume. Surface water concentrations of calcium and chloride along with total nitrogen and total phosphorus were negatively correlated with flushing times. The results herein suggest that in coastal wetlands with low quantities of surface water inputs, ET and surface water volume influenced by rainfall are the most dominant factors influencing flushing times and water chemistry. Increased surface water inflows with additional restoration efforts would be expected to increase surface water volumes into southern Taylor Slough, thereby increasing flushing times and decreasing ion and nutrient concentrations.

	abstract = {There is an increasing recognition that the influence of extreme climate events (ECE) can be more significant in structuring ecosystem dynamics than the gradual effects of climate change. Still, our understanding of the effects of climate extremes on ecosystem services such as marine fisheries lags behind those of effects of gradual change. The significance of ECEs depends on the severity of the disturbance event and the resilience of a fish community. South Florida experienced an extreme cold spell in 2010 that provided the opportunity to study recreational fisheries resilience to ECEs. Our main goal was to examine how recreational fishing catch structures responded to the cold spell, and illustrate any spatial-specific recovery trajectory dynamics after extreme ecological responses. To address this, we implemented multivariate and nonlinear statistics on fishing guide reports for 20 recreational species. A significant shift in the catch structure occurred after the event, suggesting a high sensitivity of fish populations and fisheries in the region to ECEs. All fishing regions considered were affected, but the trajectory of the response and recovery varied across study areas. While some fish species experienced an expected decline (due to mortality), other species manifested an increase in catch. Of the main seven species considered in nonlinear models, three experienced a decline (bonefish, snook, goliath grouper), two experienced an increase (red drum, gray snapper), and the two had various weak trends (tarpon, spotted seatrout). Three years after the event, the catch structure has not returned to the original state, indicating a possible state shift, whose stability needs to be determined in future tracking of affected populations. Future work should also address the extent to which harvest may interfere with resilience to ECEs. Our work highlights the need to account for rare environmental forcing induced by ECEs to ensure the ecological and economical sustainability of key services such as recreational fisheries.},

	abstract = {Predictions of above-ground biomass and the change in above-ground biomass require attachment of uncertainty due the range of reported predictions for forests. Because above-ground biomass is seldom measured, there have been no opportunities to obtain such uncertainty estimates. Standard methods involve applying an allometric equation to each individual tree on sample plots and summing the individual values. There is uncertainty in the allometry which leads to uncertainty in biomass at the tree level. Due to interdependence between competing trees, the uncertainty at the plot level that results from aggregating individual tree biomass in this way is expected to overestimate variability. That is, the variance at the plot level should be less than the sum of the individual variances. We offer a modeling strategy to learn about change in biomass at the plot level and model cumulative uncertainty to accommodate this dependence among neighboring trees. The plot-level variance is modeled using a parametric density-dependent asymptotic function. Plot-by-time covariate information is introduced to explain the change in biomass. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical model and inference is obtain within a Bayesian framework. We analyze data for the eastern United States from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program of the US Forest Service. This region contains roughly 25,000 FIA monitored plots from which there are measurements of approximately 1 million trees spanning more than 200 tree species. Due to the high species richness in the FIA data, we combine species into plant functional types. We present predictions of biomass and change in biomass for two plant functional types.},

	abstract = {Changes in climate necessitate improved snowpack information to better represent anomalous distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE) and improve water resource management. We estimate the spatial distribution of SWE for the Upper Colorado River basin weekly from January to June 2001-2012 in quasireal-time by two regression techniques: a baseline regression of in situ operationally measured point SWE using only physiographic information and regression of these in situ points combining both physiographic information and historical SWE patterns from a remote sensing-based SWE reconstruction model. We compare the baseline regression approach to our new regression in the context of spatial snow surveys and operational snow measuring stations. When compared to independent distributed snow surveys, the new regression reduces the bias of SWE estimates from -5.5\% to 0.8\%, and RMSE of the SWE estimates by 8\% from 0.25 m to 0.23 m. Notable improvements were observed in alpine terrain with bias declining from -38\% to only 3.4\%, and RMSE was reduced by 13\%, from 0.47 to 0.41 m. The mean increase in cross-validated r(2) for the new regression compared to the baseline regression is from 0.22 to 0.33. The largest increase in r(2) in any one year is 0.19, an 83\% improvement. The new regression estimates, on average, 31\% greater SWE depth than the baseline regression in areas above 3000 m elevation, which contributes up to 66\% of annual SWE volume in the driest year. This indicates that the historical SWE patterns from the reconstruction adds information to the interpolation beyond the physiographic conditions represented by the SNOTEL network. Given that previous works using SWE reconstructions were limited to retrospective analyses by necessity, the work presented here represents an important contribution in that it extends SWE reconstructions to real-time applications and illustrates that doing so significantly improves the accuracy of SWE estimates.},

The importance of improving holistic sampling in this region is clear, given its disproportionate significance to Earth and the fact that the area is exhibiting rapid change. As the Southern Ocean is beyond the capability of any single nation, the international Southern Ocean research community recognized a need for improved international coordination, strategic planning, and eventual implementation of a Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). The focus of SOOS is on (1) designing a sustainable system that provides data for determining the status and change of the Southern Ocean, (2) standardizing measurements across national efforts, (3) providing a forum for opportunities to guide future investments, (4) developing a portal for open transparent access to data, and (5) supporting grassroots discussion to identify/design expeditions and technology development. This manuscript highlights current SOOS strategies to meet those needs.

In this study, intermediate-scale soil moisture estimates from the cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) method are evaluated for two semiarid ecosystems in the southwestern United States: a mesquite savanna at the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) and a mixed shrubland at the Jornada Experimental Range (JER). Evaluations of the CRNS method are performed for small watersheds instrumented with a distributed sensor network consisting of soil moisture sensor profiles, an eddy covariance tower, and runoff flumes used to close the water balance. We found a very good agreement between the CRNS method and the distributed sensor network (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.009 and 0.013m(3) m(-3) at SRER and JER, respectively) at the hourly timescale over the 19-month study period, primarily due to the inclusion of 5 cm observations of shallow soil moisture. Good agreement was also obtained in soil moisture changes estimated from the CRNS and watershed water balance methods (RMSE of 0.001 and 0.082m(3) m(-3) at SRER and JER, respectively), with deviations due to bypassing of the CRNS measurement depth during large rainfall events. Once validated, the CRNS soil moisture estimates were used to investigate hydrological processes at the footprint scale at each site. Through the computation of the water balance, we showed that drier-than-average conditions at SRER promoted plant water uptake from deeper soil layers, while the wetter-than-average period at JER resulted in percolation towards deeper soils. The CRNS measurements were then used to quantify the link between evapotranspiration and soil moisture at a commensurate scale, finding similar predictive relations at both sites that are applicable to other semiarid ecosystems in the southwestern US.},

The median concentration of methane dissolved in fresh groundwater beneath the center of the island was 0.6 mM, supported by high rates of potential methanogenesis (22 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). However, rates of microbial methane consumption were also elevated in surrounding sediments (18 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). Groundwater flowing from the zone of methanogenesis to the point of discharge into the ocean had a long residence time within methanotrophic sediments (similar to 195 days) such that the majority of the methane produced within the barrier island aquifer was likely consumed there.

The acid-base status of soil and stream quality improved over the 12-year study, with the most pronounced response in the upper elevation and the upper soil of the watershed. A total of 95\% of the added calcium and 87\% of the added silica were retained in the watershed over the study period. Abstract In October 1999, 3450kgha(-1) of wollastonite (CaSiO3) was applied to Watershed 1 at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA, with the objective of restoring calcium that had been depleted from soil-exchange sites by chronic inputs of acid deposition. After the treatment, the concentrations and fluxes of calcium and dissolved silica significantly increased in both soil solution and stream water throughout Watershed 1, as did the acid-neutralising capacity. The concentrations and fluxes of inorganic monomeric aluminium significantly decreased. The treatment improved the acid-base status and decreased the potential for aluminium toxicity in stream water, especially in the lower reaches of the watershed. Approximately 4.7\% of the added calcium and 17\% of the added silica from the wollastonite treatment was exported from Watershed 1 in stream water by the end of 2010. Meanwhile, similar to 1825mmolm(-2) of the added calcium and 2125mmolm(-2) of the added silica were either transported to lower mineral soil horizons - as particulate wollastonite, or as dissolved solutes (calcium 77.6mmolm(-2); silica 592.2mmolm(-2)), thus contributing to increases in soil pools - or were taken up by vegetation and incorporated into internal calcium and silica cycles of the watershed ecosystem. This experimental wollastonite addition was an effective tool for mitigating the acidification of the ecosystem and restoring the calcium status and forest health of this base-poor watershed.},

Understanding intraspecific variation in the response of corals to these conditions will be important for evaluating population-level consequences of environmental change. We examined intraspecific variability in the effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide levels on net calcification (G(n)) in the coral Acropora pulchra in Moorea, French Polynesia. A common garden experiment showed that G(n) in four colonies was affected negatively by high partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) (similar to 1000 mu atm cf. similar to 400 mu atm ambient conditions), whereas elevated temperature (30 degrees C cf. 27 degrees C) had a negative effect on one colony. Together, these results reveal intraspecific variation in the response of G(n) to temperature but not to pCO(2). The fastest growing colonies under ambient temperature and ambient pCO(2) showed the greatest decline in G(n) at high temperature and elevated pCO(2). For reef corals, effects of temperature and pCO(2) on calcification that depend on the intrinsic growth rate have potentially important consequences, because they imply that coral colonies contributing the most to population- level calcification will be disproportionately affected by changing environmental conditions.},

Holocene-averaged rates of vertical motion range from subsidence of 1.4 +/- 2.4, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 0.4 +/- 0.3 mm/year in Morro Bay, Carpinteria Slough, and Goleta Slough, respectively, to possible uplift in Campus Lagoon (-0.1 +/- 0.9 mm/year). The calculated rates of subsidence are of the same magnitude as rates of relative sea-level rise experienced over the late Holocene and effectively double the ongoing rates of relative sea-level rise experienced over the last five decades on other parts of the coast. The difference in rates of vertical motion among these four estuaries is attributed to their geological settings. Estuaries developed in subsiding geological structures such as synclines and fault-bounded basins are subsiding at much higher rates than those developed within flooded river valleys incised into marine terraces. Restoration projects accounting for future sea-level rise must consider the geologic setting of the estuaries and, if applicable, include subsidence in future sea-level rise scenarios, even along the tectonically uplifting US Pacific Coast.},

	abstract = {As urban areas expand in population and geographic spread, residential landscapes become more pervasive, which is often associated with an increase in turfgrass that can contribute to changes in water use and nutrient flows. Management of these landscapes is influenced at multiple scales municipal policies, individual homeowner decision-making, and neighborhood norms, and municipal policies. Most municipalities implement policies that encourage (i.e., weed and grass height ordinances) and restrict (i.e., irrigation ordinances) lawn management. But what is the relationship between yard ordinances, homeowner awareness of these ordinances, and neighborhood yard norms? We explored this question through homeowner interviews and a review of yard ordinances in 17 cities in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area as well as interviews with code enforcement officers. We found most municipalities have lawn irrigation restrictions and weed or grass height ordinances, yet generally rely on complaints from neighbors to enforce these lawn management policies. This may be helpful when it comes to policies reinforcing agreed upon social norms-like grass height ordinances-but may be difficult with policies acting against the norm-like lawn irrigation restrictions. Additionally, homeowners in suburban areas posted high rates of awareness of local policies. Homeowner comments suggest social norms regarding lawn management are present across the urban gradient; weed-free and mowed lawns were most commonly identified. These findings have implications for policy development moving forward as cities face issues related to water scarcity or try to accommodate changing resident desires for natural landscaping.

The potential for adoption of these crops depends not only on mean net returns, but also on the associated probability distributions and on the risk preferences of farmers. Using 6-year observed crop yield data from highly productive and marginally productive sites in the southern Great Lakes region and assuming risk neutrality, we calculate expected breakeven biomass yields and prices compared to corn (Zea mays L.) as a benchmark. Next we develop Monte Carlo budget simulations based on stochastic crop prices and yields. The crop yield simulations decompose yield risk into three components: crop establishment survival, time to maturity, and mature yield variability. Results reveal that corn with harvest of grain and 38\% of stover (as cellulosic bioenergy feedstock) is both the most profitable and the least risky investment option. It dominates all perennial systems considered across a wide range of farmer risk preferences. Although not currently attractive for profit-oriented farmers who are risk neutral or risk averse, perennial bioenergy crops have a higher potential to successfully compete with corn under marginal crop production conditions.},

	abstract = {Low-relief environments like the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) have complicated hydrologic systems where surface water and groundwater processes are intimately linked yet hard to separate. Fluid exchange within these low-hydraulic-gradient systems can occur across broad spatial and temporal scales, with variable contributions to material transport and transformation. Identifying and assessing the scales at which these processes operate is essential for accurate evaluations of how these systems contribute to global biogeochemical cycles. The distribution of Rn-222 and Ra-223,Ra-224,Ra-226 have complex spatial patterns along the Shark River Slough estuary (SRSE), Everglades, FL. High-resolution time-series measurements of Rn-222 activity, salinity, and water level were used to quantify processes affecting radon fluxes out of the mangrove forest over a tidal cycle. Based on field data, tidal pumping through an extensive network of crab burrows in the lower FCE provides the best explanation for the high radon and fluid fluxes. Burrows are irrigated during rising tides when radon and other dissolved constituents are released from the mangrove soil. Flushing efficiency of the burrows-defined as the tidal volume divided by the volume of burrows-estimated for the creek drainage area vary seasonally from 25 (wet season) to 100 \% (dry season) in this study. The tidal pumping of the mangrove forest soil acts as a significant vector for exchange between the forest and the estuary. Processes that enhance exchange of O-2 and other materials across the sediment-water interface could have a profound impact on the environmental response to larger scale processes such as sea level rise and climate change. Compounding the material budgets of the SRSE are additional inputs from groundwater from the Biscayne Aquifer, which were identified using radium isotopes. Quantification of the deep groundwater component is not obtainable, but isotopic data suggest a more prevalent signal in the dry season. These findings highlight the important role that both tidal- and seasonal-scale forcings play on groundwater movement in low-gradient hydrologic systems.},

Disturbances, such as eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus (August) and traced into lipids representing benthic microalgae (BMA) and bacteria. Bacteria assimilated C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora at similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly transferred to BMA, likely via bacterial respiration. Overall, nutrient enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments. Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen enrichment effects were limited as well as provide a mechanism for retaining newly fixed and detrital carbon in coastal sediments.},

	abstract = {Streams and rivers can substantially modify organic carbon (OC) inputs from terrestrial landscapes, and much of this processing is the result of microbial respiration. While carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major end-product of ecosystem respiration, methane (CH4) is also present in many fluvial environments even though methanogenesis typically requires anoxic conditions that may be scarce in these systems. Given recent recognition of the pervasiveness of this greenhouse gas in streams and rivers, we synthesized existing research and data to identify patterns and drivers of CH4, knowledge gaps, and research opportunities. This included examining the history of lotic CH4 research, creating a database of concentrations and fluxes (MethDB) to generate a global-scale estimate of fluvial CH4 efflux, and developing a conceptual framework and using this framework to consider how human activities may modify fluvial CH4 dynamics. Current understanding of CH4 in streams and rivers has been strongly influenced by goals of understanding OC processing and quantifying the contribution of CH4 to ecosystem C fluxes. Less effort has been directed towards investigating processes that dictate in situ CH4 production and loss. CH4 makes a meager contribution to watershed or landscape C budgets, but streams and rivers are often significant CH4 sources to the atmosphere across these same spatial extents. Most fluvial systems are supersaturated with CH4 and we estimate an annual global emission of 26.8 Tg CH4, equivalent to similar to 15-40\% of wetland and lake effluxes, respectively. Less clear is the role of CH4 oxidation, methanogenesis, and total anaerobic respiration to whole ecosystem production and respiration. Controls on CH4 generation and persistence can be viewed in terms of proximate controls that influence methanogenesis (organic matter, temperature, alternative electron acceptors, nutrients) and distal geomorphic and hydrologic drivers. Multiple controls combined with its extreme redox status and low solubility result in high spatial and temporal variance of CH4 in fluvial environments, which presents a substantial challenge for understanding its larger-scale dynamics. Further understanding of CH4 production and consumption, anaerobic metabolism, and ecosystem energetics in streams and rivers can be achieved through more directed studies and comparison with knowledge from terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic disciplines.},

During January 2010, an extreme cold event in south Florida caused widespread mortality of common snook, Centropomus undecimalis, a popular sport fish. Interpretation of trends using fishery-independent monitoring data in five south Florida estuaries showed that changes in catch rates of adult snook ({\textgreater}500 mm standard length) varied between no effects postevent to large effects and 4-yr recoveries. The reasons for the variation across estuaries are unknown, but are likely related to differences in estuary geomorphology and habitat availability (e.g., extent of deep rivers and canals) and differences in the proportions of behavior contingents (i.e., segments of the population that use divergent movement tactics) that place snook in different areas of the estuary during winter. Emerging awareness of the presence of behavior contingents, identification of overwintering sites, and improvements of abundance indices in remote nursery habitats should provide a better understanding of population resilience to disturbance events for snook. Given that changes in the frequency of short-lived, severe cold events are currently unknown, the findings and management actions described here for a tropical species living at the edge of its distribution should be useful to scientists forecasting the effects of climate change.},

A species geographic range is influenced by various factors including physiological tolerance to temperature change. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature variation on thermal preference and standard metabolic rates (SMR) of two species of larval salamanders, Eurycea cirrigera (Southern Two-Lined Salamander) and Eurycea wilderae (Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander). These species share similar life histories, but E. cirrigera is broadly distributed and E. wilderae occupies a smaller range. We measured SMR using volume of oxygen consumption during closed-circuit respirometery trials conducted at 5 degrees C increments between 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Standard metabolic rates were influenced by temperature, with a range of temperature-independent SMRs observed at those temperatures above each species laboratory-determined thermal preference. Concordant with their thermal preference (15.70 degrees C) and more-narrow geographic range, E. wilderae exhibited a smaller scope of temperatures at which SMR was temperature-independent, relative to E. cirrigera, and metabolic rates were depressed at 25 degrees C. Therefore, preferred thermal temperatures corresponded with physiological maxima and environmental temperatures in each species. Our results support the importance of behavioral thermoregulation in maintaining optimal physiological function. Further, these findings indicate that the physiological specialization that occurs in species of narrow geographic ranges may preclude favorable responses to changing environmental temperatures caused by land-cover changes, including loss of riparian forest in the Eastern United States.},

Working with a panel of practitioners and regional experts, we developed and analyzed four plausible but divergent land-use scenarios that depict the future of Massachusetts from 2010 to 2060 to address two questions: (1) "How do the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem service provisioning vary under the different land-use regimes?" and (2) "What are the synergies and trade-offs among direct human uses, ecosystem services, and habitat quality?" Each scenario specifies the detailed prescriptions for the major uses of the forests, including conversion to residential and commercial development, clearing new farmland, shifting silvicultural practices, and designating forests protected from development. We simulated the land-use scenarios and their interactions with anticipated climate change by coupling statistical models of land use to the LANDIS-II landscape model and then evaluated the outcomes in terms of the magnitude and spatial distribution of (1) direct human uses of the landscape (residential and commercial development, agricultural, timber harvest), (2) ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood regulation, nutrient retention), and (3) habitat quality (forest tree species composition, interior forest habitat). Across all scenarios, conflicts occurred between dispersed residential development and the supply of ecosystem services and habitat quality. In all but the scenario that envisioned a significant agricultural expansion, forest growth resulted in net increases in aboveground carbon storage, despite the concomitant forest clearing and harvesting. One scenario, called Forests as Infrastructure, showed the potential for synergies between increased forest harvest volume through the sustainable practices that encouraged the maintenance of economically and ecologically important tree species, and carbon storage. This scenario also showed trade-offs between development density and water quantity and quality at the watershed scale. The process of integrated scenario analysis led to important insights for land managers and policymakers in a populated forested region where there are tensions among development, forest harvesting, and land conservation. More broadly, the results emphasize the need to consider the consequences of contrasting land-use regimes that result from the interactions between human decisions and spatially heterogeneous landscape dynamics.},

Higher AO rates were observed in the late winter surface mixed layer compared with the same water mass sampled during summer (mwean +/- s.e.:62 +/- 16 versus 13 +/- 2.8 nM per day, t-test P{\textless}0.0005). AO rates in the circumpolar deep water did not differ between seasons (21 +/- 5.7 versus 24 +/- 6.6 nM per day; P=0.83), despite 5- to 20-fold greater Thaumarchaeota abundance during summer. AO rates correlated with concentrations of Archaea ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes during summer, but not with concentrations of Archaea amoA transcripts, or with ratios of Archaea amoA transcripts per gene, or with concentrations of Betaproteobacterial amoA genes or transcripts. The AO rates we report ({\textless}0.1-220 nM per day) are similar to 10-fold greater than reported previously for Antarctic waters and suggest that inclusion of Antarctic coastal waters in global estimates of oceanic nitrification could increase global rate estimates by similar to 9\%. Chemoautotrophic carbon fixation supported by AO was 3-6\% of annualized phytoplankton primary production and production of Thaumarchaeota biomass supported by AO could account for similar to 9\% of the bacterioplankton production measured in winter. Growth rates of thaumarchaeote populations inferred from AO rates averaged 0.3 per day and ranged from 0.01 to 2.1 per day.},

On coral reefs, herbivores are thought to play an important role in promoting coral dominance, but how they are distributed relative to algae is not well known. Here, we evaluated whether the distribution, behavior, and condition of herbivorous fishes correlated with algal resource availability at six sites in the back reef environment of Moorea, French Polynesia. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that increased algal turf availability would coincide with (1) increased biomass, (2) altered foraging behavior, and (3) increased energy reserves of herbivorous fishes. Fish biomass and algal cover were visually estimated along underwater transects; behavior of herbivorous fishes was quantified by observations of focal individuals; fish were collected to assess their condition; and algal turf production rates were measured on standardized tiles. The best predictor of herbivorous fish biomass was algal turf production, with fish biomass increasing with algal production. Biomass of herbivorous fishes was also negatively related to sea urchin density, suggesting competition for limited resources. Regression models including both algal turf production and urchin density explained 94 \% of the variation in herbivorous fish biomass among sites spread over similar to 20 km. Behavioral observations of the parrotfish Chlorurus sordidus revealed that foraging area increased as algal turf cover decreased. Additionally, energy reserves increased with algal turf production, but declined with herbivorous fish density, implying that algal turf is a limited resource for this species. Our findings support the hypothesis that herbivorous fishes can spatially track algal resources on coral reefs.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between crime and indicators of residential yard management in Baltimore City and County. Data came from a survey we conducted of over one thousand front yards that included more than 40 indicators relating to lawns, trees, shrubs, beds and other features. These indicators were related to point counts of crime at the 150 m scale using a combination of ordinary least squares, spatial error, and Poisson regressions. After controlling for income, population density, block-scale tree canopy, and housing type, we found a consistently significant relationship between crime and a number of indicators of yard management. Yard-level variables that were negatively associated with crime included: the presence of yard trees, garden hoses/sprinklers, and lawns, in addition to the percentage of pervious area in a yard. Those positively associated with crime included presence of litter, desiccation of the lawn, lack of cutting of the lawn, and number of small trees in front of or adjacent to the property. While these results do not establish causality, they add evidence to a growing literature that suggests the possibility of several mechanisms by which environmental design may reduce crime: "cues to care" (the inverse of the "broken window" hypothesis) can lead to reduced crime by signaling to criminals the presence of social capital and the active involvement of neighbors in community spaces; and more appealing landscaping draws more "eyes on the street," which in turn deters criminals.

Using long-term study plots, we quantified population dynamics of spawning Pocillopora spp. along the north shore of Moorea between 2010 and 2014, and considered evidence that population recovery could be supported by self-seeding. Results scaled up from study plots and settlement tiles suggest that the number of Pocillopora spp. colonies on the outer reef increased 1,890-fold between 2010 and 2014/2015, and in the back reef, 8-fold between 2010 and 2014/2015. Assuming that spawning Pocillopora spp. in Moorea release similar numbers of eggs as con-generics in Hawaii, and fertilization success is similar to other spawning corals, the capacity of Pocillopora spp. to produce larvae was estimated. These estimates suggest that Pocillopora spp. in Moorea produced a large excess of larvae in 2010 and 2014 relative to the number required to produce the recruits found in the back reef and outer reef in 2010 and 2014, even assuming that similar to 99.9\% of the larvae do not recruit in Moorea. Less than a third of the recruits in one year would have to survive to produce the juvenile Pocillopora spp. found in the back and outer reefs in 2010 and 2014/2015. Our first order approximations reveal the potential for Pocillopora spp. on the north shore of Moorea to produce enough larvae to support local recruitment and population recovery following a catastrophic disturbance.},

	abstract = {Diazotrophs are the major organismal group responsible for atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) fixation in natural ecosystems. The extensive diversity and structure of N-2-fixing communities in grassland ecosystems and their responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 remain to be further explored. Through pyrosequencing of nifH gene amplicons and extraction of nifH genes from shotgun metagenomes, coupled with co-occurrence ecological network analysis approaches, we comprehensively analyzed the diazotrophic community in a grassland ecosystem exposed to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) for 12 years. Long-term eCO(2) increased the abundance of nifH genes but did not change the overall nifH diversity and diazotrophic community structure. Taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis of amplified nifH sequences suggested a high diversity of nifH genes in the soil ecosystem, the majority belonging to nifH clusters I and II. Co-occurrence ecological network analysis identified different co-occurrence patterns for different groups of diazotrophs, such as Azospirillum/Actinobacteria, Mesorhizobium/Conexibacter, and Bradyrhizobium/Acidobacteria. This indicated a potential attraction of non-N-2-fixers by diazotrophs in the soil ecosystem. Interestingly, more complex co-occurrence patterns were found for free-living diazotrophs than commonly known symbiotic diazotrophs, which is consistent with the physical isolation nature of symbiotic diazotrophs from the environment by root nodules. The study provides novel insights into our understanding of the microbial ecology of soil diazotrophs in natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses fisher-hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence variability of the Georgia Coast during the Archaic-Woodland transition, framed within ideas derived from Resilience Theory, and focusing on systemic shifts, or "collapse." A critical examination of these shifts is needed to understand how communities experience change differentially, which in turn can lead to differential community resilience. Analysis of site file and radiocarbon date databases, as well as Bayesian modeling on a subset of dates, was performed at multiple scales and within distinct micro-environmental habitats. Results indicate that as sea levels dropped, there was continuity in Late Archaic occupation within deltaic areas of the coast, with intensive shellfishing occurring earlier (similar to 5000 cal. BP) and lasting longer (similar to 3500 cal. BP). In certain habitats, occupation may have continued into the following Early Woodland period. In non deltaic areas, shellfishing occurs between 4500 and 3800 cal. BP, followed by subsistence changes and population movement. However, some of the post-3800 cal. BP occupations were fairly substantial. This differential experience of change between deltaic and non-deltaic areas was not accompanied by collapse: both areas had resilient communities. We conclude that inter-village relationships developed during the early Late Archaic period continued into the terminal portion, leading to resilience in the face of change.

Beginning immediately after snowmelt, a diurnal cycle of O-3 in the atmospheric surface layer developed with daytime O-3 maxima, and minima during low-light hours, resulting in a mean amplitude of 13ppbv. This diurnal O-3 cycle is far larger than observed at other high Arctic locations during the snow-free season. During the snow-free months of June, July, and August, O-3 deposition velocities were approximate to 3 to 5 times faster than during May, when snow covered the ground most of the month. The overall mean O-3 deposition velocity between June and August was 0.10cms(-1). The month of June had the highest diurnal variation, with a median O-3 deposition velocity of 0.2cms(-1) during the daytime and 0.08cms(-1) during low-light conditions. These values are slightly lower than previously reported summertime deposition velocities in northern latitudes over tundra or fen. O-3 loss during low-light periods was attributed to a combination of surface deposition to the tundra and stable boundary layer conditions. We also hypothesize that emissions of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds into the shallow boundary layer may contribute to nighttime O-3 loss.},

We hypothesized that the addition of light and nutrients resulting from prescribed burns in wetlands increases periphyton biomass and supports increased standing stock of marsh fishes. In the oligotrophic Everglades of Florida, USA, we conducted a 2 x 2 factorial experiment using prescribed burns over standing water (increased nutrients and light), mowing with removal of above-water vegetation (no nutrient increase), and shade houses (no light) to test the prediction that fire effects would lead to more periphyton biomass and greater abundance and size of fish compared to other treatments. We observed increased periphyton percent cover and biomass per area in response to fire treatments. Fish abundance showed a short-term increase in burned plots. Fish length, mass, and condition factor did not respond consistently to treatments, though some species responded to specific treatments. Wildfires in dry marshes that may combust organic soils and vegetation may impact wetlands more than prescribed burns in flooded marshes. Our study suggests that wetland fires can affect aquatic animal and plant community structure, at least for short periods post-fire.},

	abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines inwater clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430-US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

	abstract = {When an invasive species appears at a new location, we typically have no knowledge of the population dynamics leading up to that moment. Is the establishment of invasive propagules closely followed by the appearance of the population? Or alternatively, was there an established low-density population that was released from a constraint and crossed the detection threshold? The early stages of the invasion process are a critical gap in our knowledge, yet vitally important for the detection and management of invasions. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the lag scenario for an invasive species outbreak. The invasive predatory zooplankton, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), was detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (USA), in summer of 2009 and rapidly reached and sustained exceptionally high densities. To evaluate whether Bythotrephes' outbreak immediately followed introduction or erupted from an established low-density population, we constructed a population model of Bythotrephes in Lake Mendota. In the model, Bythotrephes persisted indefinitely at low levels until favorable thermal conditions in 2009, the coolest July since at least 1895, allowed it to erupt to high densities and establish a large egg bank in the lake sediments. The egg bank stabilized the population in the high-density state despite a return to nonfavorable thermal conditions, which is further supported by demographic data suggesting a constant contribution from the egg bank during the year. The prolonged lag scenario is corroborated by the detection of two individual Bythotrephes in pre-2009 archived samples, and the detection of Bythotrephes spines in lake sediment core layers dating back to 1994 (+/- 5 yr). Together, our results suggest that Bythotrephes persisted for at least a decade below the detection limit, until optimal thermal conditions triggered a population outbreak. This work highlights the potential for environmental conditions to trigger invasive species outbreaks from low-density populations.},

	abstract = {The interplay between storms and sea level rise, and between ecology and sediment transport governs the behavior of rapidly evolving coastal ecosystems such as marshes and barrier islands. Sediment deposition during hurricanes is thought to increase the resilience of salt marshes to sea level rise by increasing soil elevation and vegetation productivity. We use mesocosms to simulate burial of Spartina alterniflora during hurricane-induced overwash events of various thickness (0-60 cm), and find that adventitious root growth within the overwash sediment layer increases total biomass by up to 120\%. In contrast to most previous work illustrating a simple positive relationship between burial depth and vegetation productivity, our work reveals an optimum burial depth (510 cm) beyond which burial leads to plant mortality. The optimum burial depth increases with flooding frequency, indicating that storm deposition ameliorates flooding stress, and that its impact on productivity will become more important under accelerated sea level rise. Our results suggest that frequent, low magnitude storm events associated with naturally migrating islands may increase the resilience of marshes to sea level rise, and in turn, slow island migration rates. Synthesis: We find that burial deeper than the optimum results in reduced growth or mortality of marsh vegetation, which suggests that future increases in overwash thickness associated with more intense storms and artificial heightening of dunes could lead to less resilient marshes.},

The data employed include MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) 8-day composite June imagery, and classified LULC maps generated using 2000 and 2014 Landsat imagery. Results show that the regions that experienced the most significant LST changes during the study period are primarily on the outskirts of the Phoenix metropolitan area for both daytime and nighttime. The conversion to urban, residential, and impervious surfaces from all other LULC types has been identified as the primary cause of the UHI effect in Phoenix. Vegetation cover has been shown to significantly lower LST for both daytime and nighttime due to its strong cooling effect by producing more latent heat flux and less sensible heat flux.

One reason for this uncertainty lies in the multitude of methodological approaches to sampling biodiversity and productivity, some of which can be subjective. Remote sensing offers new, objective ways of assessing productivity and biodiversity. In this study, we tested the species richness-productivity relationship using a common remote sensing index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a measure of productivity in experimental prairie grassland plots (Cedar Creek). Our study spanned a growing season (May to October, 2014) to evaluate dynamic changes in the NDVI-species richness relationship through time and in relation to environmental variables and phenology. We show that NDVI, which is strongly associated with vegetation percent cover and biomass, is related to biodiversity for this prairie site, but it is also strongly influenced by other factors, including canopy growth stage, short-term water stress and shifting flowering patterns. Remarkably, the NDVI-biodiversity correlation peaked at mid-season, a period of warm, dry conditions and anthesis, when NDVI reached a local minimum. These findings confirm a positive, but dynamic, productivity-diversity relationship and highlight the benefit of optical remote sensing as an objective and non-invasive tool for assessing diversity-productivity relationships.},

However, the impact of increasing density on interactions among trees at treeline is not well understood. Here, we test if treeline densification induced by climatic warming leads to increasing intraspecific competition. We mapped and measured the size and age of Smith fir trees growing in two treelines located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We used spatial point-pattern and codispersion analyses to describe the spatial association and covariation among seedlings, juveniles, and adults grouped in 30-yr age classes from the 1860s to the present. Effects of competition on tree height and regeneration were inferred from bivariate mark-correlations. Since the 1950s, a rapid densification occurred at both sites in response to climatic warming. Competition between adults and juveniles or seedlings at small scales intensified as density increased. Encroachment negatively affected height growth and further reduced recruitment around mature trees. We infer that tree recruitment at the studied treelines was more cold-limited prior to 1950 and shifted to a less temperature-constrained regime in response to climatic warming. Therefore, the ongoing densification and encroachment of alpine treelines could alter the way climate drives their transitions toward subalpine forests.},

Andrews Experimental Forest, monitoring tracer concentrations in the stream and in a network of shallow riparian wells in each watershed. We found hyporheic mean arrival time, temporal variance, and fraction of stream water in the bedrock-constrained valley bottom and near large roughness elements in the wider valley bottom were not variable with discharge, suggesting minimal control by hydrologic forcing. Conversely, we observed increases in mean arrival time and temporal variance and decreasing fraction stream water with decreasing discharge near the hillslopes in the wider valley bottom. This may indicate changes in stream discharge and valley bottom hydrology control transport in less constrained locations. We detail five hydrogeomorphic responses to base flow recession to explain observed spatial and temporal patterns in the interactions between streams and their valley bottoms. Models able to account for the transition from geologically dominated processes in the near-stream subsurface to hydrologically dominated processes near the hillslope will be required to predict solute transport and fate in valley bottoms of headwater mountain streams.},

Scenario developers integrate stakeholder perceptions into storylines to increase scenario relevance and plausibility while relying on archetypes of change from scenario literature to enrich narratives. This research examines the contributions of local perspectives and global archetypes to scenario development through a case study of a regional scenario project, Yahara 2070, in Wisconsin, USA. Interviews with 50 Yahara watershed stakeholders and 5 members of the project's scenario development team were examined to compare themes from scenario archetypes with local perspectives on how change is expected to occur. We next examined how these two sources of inspiration for trajectories of change were used in the development of the Yahara 2070 scenarios. Both global archetypes and local stakeholders emphasized social values, market forces, and policy reform as influences in determining the future, which were reflected in Yahara 2070. However, stakeholders were less likely to mention institutional breakdown, an important theme from the global scenarios literature that was included in Yahara 2070. This research offers a new approach to analyzing similarities and differences between scenarios' narratives and local perspectives. Scenario development may involve tensions between the goals of reflecting stakeholder views and including narratives from the global scenarios literature that may be useful for creating divergent model trajectories and addressing dramatic change into the future. To improve scenario development, scenario projects should document the development process in academic and nonacademic venues, explicitly highlighting sources and constraints in storyline development.},

	abstract = {Pinon (Pious edulis) juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (PJ) woodlands cover 17+ million hectares in the western USA. These woodlands have been particularly sensitive to recent changes in climate, with drought induced die-offs of pinon occurring across 1.5 million ha, since 2000, triggering large changes in the structure and function of these biomes. To assess the effects of this large scale mortality on soil processes, we analyzed rhizosphere extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and fungal biomass in soil samples collected beneath tree canopies at two pinon juniper woodland sites: one site where pinons were experimentally killed by girdling, and a paired intact site with no pinon mortality that served as a reference. We also quantified soil water content (SWC) from soil samples, and sap flow density fluxes as an indicator of tree physiological status. Soil EEA patterns varied as functions of the identity of the closest competitor trees, host-tree physiological status, and SWC. At the girdled site, we observed higher plant cell wall related decomposition activities under live juniper canopies, compared to dead pinon trees. In contrast, at the control site, we observed higher plant cell wall decomposition rates under live pinon rather than juniper canopies, particularly with higher soil moisture availability. At the site level, ordination plots for intact PJ woodlands showed a decreasing trend in microbial cell wall decomposition activity as soil water availability, and fungal biomass increased. We observed the opposite trend at the girdled site. Overall, these results suggest that widespread pinon mortality significantly affects the functional behavior of rhizosphere microorganisms at multiple scales, in part by shifting the focal substrates of microbial community decomposition.

In forested freshwater ecosystems, shading by streamside (riparian) vegetation is a dominant control on light flux and represents an important interaction at the aquatic-terrestrial interface. Changes in forest structure over time, particularly tree mortality processes that gradually increase light penetration through maturing forest canopies, are likely to influence stream light fluxes and associated ecosystem functions. We provide a set of conceptual models describing how stream light dynamics change with the development of complex canopy structure and how changes in light availability are likely to affect stream ecosystem processes. Shortly after a stand-replacing event, light flux to the stream is high, but light fluxes decline as canopies reestablish and close. Tree density, the degree of understory growth, patterns of tree mortality, and small-scale disturbances interact as drivers of multiple pathways of forest structural development. Changes in canopy structure will, in turn, influence stream light, which is expected to impact primary production and stream nutrient dynamics as well as the amount of autochthonous carbon supporting aquatic food webs. Ultimately, these conceptual models stress the-importance of recovery from historic forest disturbances as well as future forest change as important factors influencing the long-term trajectories of ecosystem processes in headwaters.},

Here, we use embedded fluorescence sensors that sample at high frequency to investigate the daily dynamics of a proxy for the major pool of organic carbon (chromophoric dissolved organic matter, CDOM) in a clear-water Wisconsin lake (similar to 3 mg C.L-1). We compare the diel CDOM cycle in this lake with cycles observed previously in two dark-water lakes (10 to 20 mg C.L-1). Despite differences in DOM quality and quantity, diel fluorescence cycles were evident in the epilimnia and hypolimnia of all three lakes. The amplitude differed among lakes, but the timing of the diel cycles was similar, with increases in fluorescence during nighttime and decreases during daylight (except in the aphotic hypolimnion of the darkest lake). The amplitude of the diel cycle increased with increasing DOM concentration, and estimates of DOM turnover based on the magnitude of oscillation ranged from 0.28 mg C.L-1.day(-1) in the darkest lake to 0.14 mg C.L-1.day(-1) in the clear lake. Independent estimates of free water metabolism based on the daily dynamics of O-2 or CO2 were in general agreement, ranging from 0.32 to 0.06 mg C.L-1.day(-1). Although absolute rates of turnover varied directly with DOM concentration, relative rates were highest in clear waters (similar to 5\%.day(-1)). We conclude that these daily oscillations may be a common property of lakes and that they may provide insights into internal DOM processing over short time scales.},

	abstract = {Permafrost soils currently store approximately 1672Pg of carbon (C), but as high latitudes warm, this temperature-protected C reservoir will become vulnerable to higher rates of decomposition. In recent decades, air temperatures in the high latitudes have warmed more than any other region globally, particularly during the winter. Over the coming century, the arctic winter is also expected to experience the most warming of any region or season, yet it is notably understudied. Here we present nonsummer season (NSS) CO2 flux data from the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research project, an ecosystem warming experiment of moist acidic tussock tundra in interior Alaska. Our goals were to quantify the relationship between environmental variables and winter CO2 production, account for subnivean photosynthesis and late fall plant C uptake in our estimate of NSS CO2 exchange, constrain NSS CO2 loss estimates using multiple methods of measuring winter CO2 flux, and quantify the effect of winter soil warming on total NSS CO2 balance. We measured CO2 flux using four methods: two chamber techniques (the snow pit method and one where a chamber is left under the snow for the entire season), eddy covariance, and soda lime adsorption, and found that NSS CO2 loss varied up to fourfold, depending on the method used. CO2 production was dependent on soil temperature and day of season but atmospheric pressure and air temperature were also important in explaining CO2 diffusion out of the soil. Warming stimulated both ecosystem respiration and productivity during the NSS and increased overall CO2 loss during this period by 14\% (this effect varied by year, ranging from 7 to 24\%). When combined with the summertime CO2 fluxes from the same site, our results suggest that this subarctic tundra ecosystem is shifting away from its historical function as a C sink to a C source.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems currently offset one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions because of a slight imbalance between global terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration(1). Understanding what controls these two biological fluxes is therefore crucial to predicting climate change(2). Yet there is no way of directly measuring the photosynthesis or daytime respiration of a whole ecosystem of interacting organisms; instead, these fluxes are generally inferred from measurements of net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (NEE), in a way that is based on assumed ecosystem-scale responses to the environment. The consequent view of temperate deciduous forests (an important CO2 sink) is that, first, ecosystem respiration is greater during the day than at night; and second, ecosystem photosynthetic light-use efficiency peaks after leaf expansion in spring and then declines(3), presumably because of leaf ageing or water stress. This view has underlain the development of terrestrial biosphere models used in climate prediction(4,5) and of remote sensing indices of global biosphere productivity(5,6). Here, we use new isotopic instrumentation(7) to determine ecosystem photosynthesis and daytime respiration(8) in a temperate deciduous forest over a three-year period. We find that ecosystem respiration is lower during the day than at night-the first robust evidence of the inhibition of leaf respiration by light(9-11) at the ecosystem scale. Because they do not capture this effect, standard approaches(12,13) overestimate ecosystem photosynthesis and daytime respiration in the first half of the growing season at our site, and inaccurately portray ecosystem photosynthetic light-use efficiency. These findings revise our understanding of forest-atmosphere carbon exchange, and provide a basis for investigating how leaf-level physiological dynamics manifest at the canopy scale in other ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Urbanized areas increasingly rely on constructed treatment wetlands (CTW) for cost effective and environmentally-based wastewater treatment. Constructed treatment wetlands are particularly attractive treatment options in arid urban environments where water reuse is important for dealing with scarce water resources. Emergent macrophytes play an important role in nutrient removal, particularly nitrogen (N) removal, in CTW. However, the role of plant community composition in nutrient removal is less clear. Numerous studies have shown that macrophyte species differentially affect N uptake processes (e.g., direct plant uptake, coupled nitrification-denitrification, soil accretion). However, many of these studies have been based on small-scale experiments and have been carried out in mesic environments, which means that their findings are difficult to extrapolate to aridland CTW systems. Our study sought to examine the relationships among emergent macrophyte productivity, plant community composition, and N uptake [by both the plants and the entire ecosystem] at a 42 ha CTW in arid Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We quantified above- and belowground biomass bimonthly and foliar N content annually for four species groups (Typha latifolia + Typha domingensis,Schoenoplectus califomicus + Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Schoenoplectus acutus, and Schoenoplectus americanus) from July 2011 to September 2013. We quantified dissolved inorganic N fluxes into and out of the system and compared plant N removal to total system fluxes. Additionally, we estimated monotypic N content for each to compare the system's current community composition and plant N removal to hypothetical scenarios in which the system was dominated by only one species. Peak aboveground biomass ranged from 1586 +/- 179 (SE) to 2666 +/- 164 (SE) gdw m(-2) of which Typha spp. accounted for an increasing portion ({\textgreater}66\%). We observed widespread 'thatching' - the toppling of large stands of macrophytes - that was likely related to a decline in peak biomass from July 2011 to July 2012. The foliar N content was similar among the species groups and N content for all species combined, at peak biomass, was 31 +/- 8 N g m(-2). This measured foliar N content was higher than our estimates of the foliar N content in hypothetical monotypic stands, suggesting that the system's actual community composition performed better, in terms of direct plant N uptake, than if the system had been planted with only one species group. Overall, direct plant N uptake accounted for 7\% of inorganic N inputs and 19\% of whole-system inorganic N removal. Our findings suggest that managers and designers should consider diverse plant communities rather than monotypic stands when designing, constructing, and managing CWT wetland systems. Future research is needed to elucidate those management strategies that might best promote or preserve diverse plant communities in these systems in a cost effective manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Crab spiders may use UV signalling to lure potential prey to the flowers they occupy. 3. In the present study, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of crab spiders occupying three prairie plant species for the insect flower-visitor community. Pollinating insects were significantly attracted to inflorescences with crab spiders compared to inflorescences without crab spiders for two plant species, and herbivorous insects were attracted to inflorescences with crab spiders for one of these plant species. The two flowering plant species with increased pollinator visitation showed increased seed weights for plants with crab spiders, indicating crab spider presence indirectly increased pollination. 4. To test the UV signalling hypothesis, inflorescences with crab spiders of one plant species were observed under both a UV-blocking plastic and a clear plastic control. Contrary to our prediction, flower-visitors were not more likely to land on inflorescences under the clear plastic; the UV signalling hypothesis was not supported. Other unknown explanations underlie prey attraction to inflorescences with crab spiders.},

We followed up this observation with 4 years of in situ monitoring of caged mussels stocked across a depth-temperature gradient in Gull Lake. Mortality of caged D. polymorpha was largely explained by accumulated degree hours {\textgreater}25 degrees C, a temperature threshold that is considerably lower than laboratory-derived lethal temperatures for D. polymorpha. We also assessed both the acute and chronic thermal tolerance of Gull Lake D. polymorpha with laboratory experiments, which confirmed higher acute tolerance (up to 32 degrees C) under otherwise ideal conditions but high susceptibility to prolonged exposure to "sublethal" temperatures (exceeding 1700 degree hours {\textgreater}25 degrees C) as occurred in Gull Lake during the die-off. Our results indicate that the thermal tolerance of D. polymorpha under natural conditions may be lower than has been reported from laboratory studies.

Patterns and relationships were evaluated spatially among sites and temporally within sites during non-drought and drought periods in tallgrass prairie streams of eastern Kansas, U.S.A. Supra-seasonal drought during 2011-2013 resulted in complete or partial drying of some sites and provided an opportunity to evaluate whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction. Abundance was used to predict re-colonisation in desiccated reaches and persistence in drying pools. Few species were common, while most were rare regardless of drought, and nestedness drove community dissimilarity across sites. Common species had higher colonisation and lower extinction than rarer species, but physiological tolerance was unrelated to commonness. Abundant species were generally the first to re-colonise desiccated reaches, but pre-drought abundance did not predict persistence in partially desiccated reaches. Although common species were the first to colonise and the last to go extinct, we were unable to determine whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction. Regardless, our study demonstrates linkages among commonness, colonisation and extinction.},

	abstract = {While there has been long-term interest in identifying agricultural practices which promote soil ecological services, there remains little consensus on how practices such as low-input and organic impact soil microbial communities and their functions. In order to improve understanding of the response of soil microbial communities to shifts in agricultural management programs, a two year field study was conducted on large-scale conventional, low-input and organic fields associate with the Kellogg Biological Station, Long Term Ecological Research site near Kalamazoo, MI. Because large commercial agricultural fields typically exhibit diverse topography, plots were established in all fields at unique landscape positions to explore interactions between management and topographical position. Over the course of two growing seasons, differences in microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme production and carbon and nitrogen mineralization were quantified at different topographical positions (summits, slopes, and depressions) in each of the three agricultural management systems. Alone, management practices had little to no impact on soil microbial traits, however, significant management by landscape position and management by time interactions were observed for extracellular enzymes. Acid phosphatase activity on hill slopes was 35-52\% greater in low input systems than in conventional and organic management systems. Similarly, spring amino peptidase activity was roughly 100\% higher in low input than in organic systems. Landscape position also had substantial effects on both microbial biomass and enzyme activities. Topographical depressions exhibited significantly higher activities of beta-N-acetylglucosaminadase, P-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and greater microbial biomass than summits and slopes (26\%, 30\%, 36\%, and 55\%, respectively). Similarly, peroxidase activity was approximately 38\% greater in depressions and on summits than on hill slopes. Differences in microbial traits among positions were also negatively correlated with soil bulk density and sand content and positively correlated with clay, silt, carbon, nitrogen and moisture content. Our study stresses the importance of accounting for topographical heterogeneity when assessing the impact of management practices on belowground ecological function. Further, while management practices alone had little effect on soil microbial biomass and function, our study demonstrates that low input management programs may be beneficial for retaining microbial resources and thus promoting microbial activity on erosion-prone hill slopes.

	abstract = {Global changes are altering many important drivers of ecosystem functioning, with precipitation amount and disturbance frequency being especially important. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools are key contemporary attributes of ecosystems that can also influence future C uptake via plant growth. Thus, understanding the impacts of altered precipitation amounts (through controls of primary production inputs) and disturbance regimes (through losses of C and N in biomass) is important to project how ecosystem services will respond to future global changes. A major difficulty inherent within this task is that drivers of ecosystem function and processes often interact, resulting in novel ecosystem responses. To examine how changes in precipitation affect grassland ecosystem responses under a frequent disturbance regime (annual fire), we assessed the biogeochemical and ecological consequences of more than two decades of irrigation in an annually burned mesic grassland in the central United States. In this experiment, precipitation amount was increased by 31\% relative to ambient and 1 in 3years were statistically extreme relative to the long-term historical record. Despite evidence that irrigation decreased root:shoot ratios and increased rates of N cyclingeach expected to reduce soil C and N with annual burningwe detected no changes in these biogeochemical pools. This surprising biogeochemical resistance highlights the need to explore additional mechanisms within long-term experiments concerning the consequences of global change impacts on ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The measurement of stress hormone (glucocorticoid [GC]) concentration is increasingly used to assess the health of wildlife populations. However, for many species, we do not have a good understanding of the range of GC concentrations that might indicate a compromised individual. A temporary increase in GC concentration can prompt the adoption of behavior or activities to promote individual survival. However, chronic GC elevation results in deleterious effects on health that can reduce survival. In order to use GC concentration as a metric of individual fitness for a given species, it will be necessary to relate individual demographic rates to GC concentration. We related survival in American pikas (Ochotona princeps) to 2 different stress metrics, glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) concentration in fecal samples and GC concentration in plasma samples. Annual survival was analyzed in relation to each of these stress metrics as well as other physiological metrics and habitat characteristics at several sites in the Rocky Mountains. Among the predictors considered, GCM concentration was by far the strongest predictor of annual survival in pikas, and individuals with higher baseline GCM were less likely to survive. Our metric of flea load was also negatively related to annual survival. Given the limited time and resources that characterize many wildlife conservation projects, it is important to establish which endocrine metrics are the most informative for a species. American pikas have been identified as a sentinel species for detecting effects of climate change, and several correlational studies have projected range contraction for the species. Our results suggest that more mechanistic projections might be possible given further study of the relationship between GCM and climate. Our approach contributes to a better understanding of factors affecting survival in this species and provides a basis for further research relating individual stress response and survival to environmental change.},

Over the course of a full year, fluorescence, absorbance and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were characterised in Bigelow Brook, a forested headwater stream in Massachusetts, USA. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified a four-component model to describe observed DOM fluorescence (C1-C4). Component C2 exhibited the characteristics of a more humic-like fluorophore, with a potentially more reduced redox state and increased with discharge, whereas more fulvic-like (C1) and protein-like (C3, C4) fluorophores decreased. Under both dark and light-exposed conditions, percentage bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (\% BDOC) increased with discharge (R-2 = 0.37 and R-2 = 0.56). C2 and specific absorptivity (SUVA) were reduced following BDOC incubations, whereas C1, C3 and C4 increased. These changes to DOM characteristics with increasing discharge were observed under both baseflow and stormflow conditions, indicating that with rising watertable, loading from a large riparian or hyporheic pool of organic matter is likely occurring. Other headwater streams, where loading is controlled by hillslope processes, are likely to exhibit a similar pattern of increasing export of more humic and bioavailable DOM during hydrologic events.},

Based on 15years of eddy covariance measurements in Colorado, years with earlier snowmelt exhibited less net carbon uptake during the snow ablation period, which is a period of high potential for productivity. Earlier snowmelt aligned with colder periods of the seasonal air temperature cycle relative to later snowmelt. We found that the colder ablation-period air temperatures during these early snowmelt years lead to reduced rates of daily NEE. Hence, earlier snowmelt associated with climate warming, counterintuitively, leads to colder atmospheric temperatures during the snow ablation period and concomitantly reduced rates of net carbon uptake. Using a multilinear-regression (R-2=0.79, P{\textless}0.001) relating snow ablation period mean air temperature and peak snow water equivalent (SWE) to ablation-period NEE, we predict that earlier snowmelt and decreased SWE may cause a 45\% reduction in midcentury ablation-period net carbon uptake.},

	abstract = {Streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica moderate an important hydrologic and biogeochemical connection between upland alpine glaciers, valley-bottom soils, and lowland closed-basin lakes. Moreover, MDV streams are simple but dynamic systems ideal for studying interacting hydrologic and ecological dynamics. This work synthesizes 20years of hydrologic data, collected as part of the MDVs Long-Term Ecological Research project, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrologic connectivity between glaciers, streams, and lakes. Long-term records of stream discharge (Q), specific electrical conductance (EC), and water temperature (T) from 18 streams were analysed in order to quantify the magnitude, duration, and frequency of hydrologic connections over daily, annual, and inter-annual timescales. At a daily timescale, we observe predictable diurnal variations in Q, EC, and T. At an annual timescale, we observe longer streams to be more intermittent, warmer, and have higher median EC values, compared to shorter streams. Longer streams also behave chemostatically with respect to EC, whereas shorter streams are more strongly characterized by dilution. Inter-annually, we observe significant variability in annual runoff volumes, likely because of climatic variability over the 20 record years considered. Hydrologic connections at all timescales are vital to stream ecosystem structure and function. This synthesis of hydrologic connectivity in the MDVs provides a useful end-member template for assessing hydrologic connectivity in more structurally complex temperate watersheds.

	abstract = {The global terrestrial carbon sink offsets one-third of the world's fossil fuel emissions, but the strength of this sink is highly sensitive to large-scale extreme events. In 2012, the contiguous United States experienced exceptionally warm temperatures and the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, resulting in substantial economic damage. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of such events because warmer temperatures and a higher prevalence of drought are projected in a changing climate. Here, we combine an extensive network of direct ecosystem flux measurements with satellite remote sensing and atmospheric inverse modeling to quantify the impact of the warmer spring and summer drought on biosphere-atmosphere carbon and water exchange in 2012. We consistently find that earlier vegetation activity increased spring carbon uptake and compensated for the reduced uptake during the summer drought, which mitigated the impact on net annual carbon uptake. The early phenological development in the Eastern Temperate Forests played a major role for the continental-scale carbon balance in 2012. The warm spring also depleted soilwater resources earlier, and thus exacerbated water limitations during summer. Our results show that the detrimental effects of severe summer drought on ecosystem carbon storage can be mitigated by warming-induced increases in spring carbon uptake. However, the results also suggest that the positive carbon cycle effect of warm spring enhances water limitations and can increase summer heating through biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Despite its wide geographic distribution and important role in boreal forest fire regimes, little is known about the climate-growth relationships of black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.). We used site-and tree-level analyses to evaluate the radial growth responses to climate of black spruce growing on a north-facing toposequence in interior Alaska for the period A.D. 1949-2010. At the site level, correlations between growth and climate were negative for temperature and positive for precipitation. The signs and strengths of these correlations varied seasonally and over time. These site-level differences probably arise from tree interactions with non-climatic factors that vary with topography and include active layer thickness, soil temperature, solar radiation, microsite, and tree architecture. We infer that black spruce suffers from drought stress during warm, dry summers and that the causes of this moisture stress relate to topography and the seasonality of drought. Tree-level analyses reveal that divergent inter-tree growth responses among individual trees at the same site also occur, with the lower slope positions having the greatest frequency of mixed responses. The overall complexity of black spruce's climate-growth relationships reflects the plastic growth strategy that enables this species to tolerate harsh, high-latitude conditions across a transcontinental range.},

Microbial activity is a key regulator of available P through organic matter decomposition (supply) as well as microbial immobilization (depletion). Environmental conditions, such as soil moisture and temperature can fluctuate significantly on hourly to daily time-scales in tropical forested ecosystems. Given the ability of microbes to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions we would expect concomitant changes in the available soil P pool. Despite the potential for soil P availability to vary on short time-scales, research that investigates hourly to daily changes in the available soil P pool in tropical forests is extremely rare. We quantified diurnal fluctuations in labile soil P and the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns in a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Hourly measurements of Bray-extractable P were made from sunrise to sunset on five separate days along with measurements of soil temperature, moisture, pH, soil respiration, and solar radiation. While we found no significant diurnal variation in labile P, it did, however, vary significantly across the five sample days (2.8-3.8 A mu g/g). The day-to-day variation in labile P was positively related to soil moisture (R-2 = 0.42, p = 0.009). These findings illustrate the potential for rapid change in the available P pool in response to variable soil moisture status as well as the importance of considering soil moisture conditions when estimating P availability in the humid tropics.},

Biological uptake of nitrate (NO3-) is a major pathway by which N is removed from these ecosystems. Here we used data from the second Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX II) in a multivariate analysis to identify the primary drivers of variation in NO3- uptake velocity among biomes. Across 69 study watersheds in North America, dissolved organic carbon: NO3- ratios and photosynthetically active radiation were identified as the two most important predictor variables in explaining NO3- uptake velocity. However, within a specific biome the predictor variables of NO3- uptake velocity varied and included various physical, chemical, and biological attributes. Our analysis demonstrates the broad control of elemental stoichiometry on NO3- uptake velocity as well as the importance of biome-specific predictors. Understanding this spatial variation has important implications for biome-specific watershed management and the downstream export of NO3-, as well as for development of spatially explicit global models that describe N dynamics in streams and rivers.},

According to source apportionment analysis, biomass burning had the highest contribution (50.3\%) to average WSOC concentration; SOA formation and motor vehicle emissions dominated the contribution to WSOC in the summer.

Individual body size variation is a key evolutionary phenomenon and closely related to ecological diversity and species adaptation. Using a macroecological approach, I test 57 Long-Term Ecological Research data sets and show that a power-law and a generalized power-law function describe well the mean-variance scaling of individual body mass. This relationship connects Taylor's law and density mass allometry, and leads to a new scaling pattern between the individual body size variation and population abundance fluctuation, which is confirmed using freshwater fish and forest tree data. Underlying mechanisms and implications of the proposed scaling relationships are discussed.

The abundances of microbial functional genes involved in both aerobic and anaerobic carbon decomposition were also markedly increased by this short-term warming. Consistent with this, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) increased up to 38\%. In addition, warming enhanced genes involved in nutrient cycling, which very likely contributed to an observed increase (30\%) in gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the GPP increase did not offset the extra R-eco, resulting in significantly more net carbon loss in warmed plots compared with control plots.

	abstract = {The invasion of exotic grasses into shrublands is a major disturbance to dryland ecosystems. The presence of exotic grasses enhances the occurrence of wildfire in landscapes that had not evolved in the presence of fire, leading to high rates of mortality of the native vegetation. Exotic grasses could be more prone to water stress and mortality than the shrubs they replaced and may not establish during drought, facts that are crucial in ecosystems undergoing increased climatic variability. Here, we develop a process-based modelling framework to investigate the complex dynamics resulting from the introduction of exotic grasses under variable climate. We find that the system converges towards different steady states, depending on the magnitude of climatic variability. While in the absence of climate fluctuations the shrubland state is replaced by an exotic grassland, interannual climate variability may inhibit grass invasion and stabilize the shrubland state. However, climatic variability also gives rise to a novel third, unvegetated state, with grass invasion being followed by drought, grass mortality and intense soil erosion. Most of the research on climate change effects on ecosystems has historically concentrated on the ecological impact of shifts in mean climate conditions. This study shows that changes in the variance are also important when shifts in vegetation composition (e.g. species invasions) result in different susceptibility to climatic variability. In the presence of random climate fluctuations, ecosystems can display steady states that differ from those that would exist under a constant climate or with a climate trend.

Different bacterial communities inhabited different alpine meadows, reflecting differences in moisture, nutrients and plant species. Bacterial community alpha-diversity metrics were strongly correlated with plant richness and the production of forbs. After meadow type, N addition proved the strongest determinant of bacterial community structure. Structural Equation Modeling demonstrated that tundra bacterial community responses to N addition occur via changes in plant community composition and soil pH resulting from N inputs, thus disentangling the influence of direct (resource availability) vs. indirect (changes in plant community structure and soil pH) N effects that have remained unexplored in past work examining bacterial responses to long-term N inputs in these vulnerable environments. Across meadow types, the relative influence of these indirect N effects on bacterial community structure varied. In explicitly evaluating the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of long-term N addition on bacterial communities, this study provides new mechanistic understandings of the interaction between plant and microbial community responses to N inputs amidst environmental change.},

	abstract = {In flood-pulsed ecosystems, hydrology and landscape structure mediate transfers of energy up the food chain by expanding and contracting in area, enabling spatial expansion and growth of fish populations during rising water levels, and subsequent concentration during the drying phase. Connectivity of flooded areas is dynamic as waters rise and fall, and is largely determined by landscape geomorphology and anisotropy. We developed a methodology for simulating fish dispersal and concentration on spatially-explicit, dynamic floodplain wetlands with pulsed food web dynamics, to evaluate how changes in connectivity through time contribute to the concentration of fish biomass that is essential for higher trophic levels. The model also tracks a connectivity index (DCI) over different compass directions to see if fish biomass dynamics can be related in a simple way to topographic pattern. We demonstrate the model for a seasonally flood-pulsed, oligotrophic system, the Everglades, where flow regimes have been greatly altered. Three dispersing populations of functional fish groups were simulated with empirically-based dispersal rules on two landscapes, and two twelve-year time series of managed water levels for those areas were applied. The topographies of the simulations represented intact and degraded ridge-and slough landscapes (RSL). Simulation results showed large pulses of biomass concentration forming during the onset of the drying phase, when water levels were falling and fish began to converge into the sloughs. As water levels fell below the ridges, DCI declined over different directions, closing down dispersal lanes, and fish density spiked. Persistence of intermediate levels of connectivity on the intact RSL enabled persistent concentration events throughout the drying phase. The intact landscape also buffered effects of wet season population growth. Water level reversals on both landscapes negatively affected fish densities by depleting fish populations without allowing enough time for them to regenerate. Testable, spatiotemporal predictions of the timing, location, duration, and magnitude of fish concentration pulses were produced by the model, and can be applied to restoration planning.

	abstract = {Forest carbon (C) density varies tremendously across space due to the inherent heterogeneity of forest ecosystems. Variation of forest C density is especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, where environmental gradients are compressed and vary at multiple spatial scales. Additionally, the influence of environmental gradients may vary with forest age and developmental stage, an important consideration as forest landscapes often have a diversity of stand ages from past management and other disturbance agents. Quantifying forest C density and its underlying environmental determinants in mountain terrain has remained challenging because many available data sources lack the spatial grain and ecological resolution needed at both stand and landscape scales. The objective of this study was to determine if environmental factors influencing aboveground live carbon (ALC) density differed between young versus old forests. We integrated aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) data with 702 field plots to map forest ALC density at a grain of 25 m across the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a 6369 ha watershed in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. We used linear regressions, random forest ensemble learning (RF) and sequential autoregressive modeling (SAR) to reveal how mapped forest ALC density was related to climate, topography, soils, and past disturbance history (timber harvesting and wildfires). ALC increased with stand age in young managed forests, with much greater variation of ALC in relation to years since wildfire in old unmanaged forests. Timber harvesting was the most important driver of ALC across the entire watershed, despite occurring on only 23\% of the landscape. More variation in forest ALC density was explained in models of young managed forests than in models of old unmanaged forests. Besides stand age, ALC density in young managed forests was driven by factors influencing site productivity, whereas variation in ALC density in old unmanaged forests was also affected by finer scale topographic conditions associated with sheltered sites. Past wildfires only had a small influence on current ALC density, which may be a result of long times since fire and/or prevalence of non-stand replacing fire. Our results indicate that forest ALC density depends on a suite of multi-scale environmental drivers mediated by complex mountain topography, and that these relationships are dependent on stand age. The high and context-dependent spatial variability of forest ALC density has implications for quantifying forest carbon stores, establishing upper bounds of potential carbon sequestration, and scaling field data to landscape and regional scales.

	abstract = {Light use efficiency (LUE) models are widely used to simulate gross primary production (GPP). However, the treatment of the plant canopy as a big leaf by these models can introduce large uncertainties in simulated GPP. Recently, a two-leaf light use efficiency (TL-LUE) model was developed to simulate GPP separately for sunlit and shaded leaves and has been shown to outperform the big-leaf MOD17 model at six FLUX sites in China. In this study we investigated the performance of the TL-LUE model for a wider range of biomes. For this we optimized the parameters and tested the TL-LUE model using data from 98 FLUXNET sites which are distributed across the globe. The results showed that the TL-LUE model performed in general better than the MOD17 model in simulating 8 day GPP. Optimized maximum light use efficiency of shaded leaves (epsilon(msh)) was 2.63 to 4.59 times that of sunlit leaves (epsilon(msu)). Generally, the relationships of epsilon(msh) and epsilon(msu) with epsilon(max) were well described by linear equations, indicating the existence of general patterns across biomes. GPP simulated by the TL-LUE model was much less sensitive to biases in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) input than the MOD17 model. The results of this study suggest that the proposed TL-LUE model has the potential for simulating regional and global GPP of terrestrial ecosystems, and it is more robust with regard to usual biases in input data than existing approaches which neglect the bimodal within-canopy distribution of PAR.},

	abstract = {Despite documented intra-urban heterogeneity in the urban heat island (UHI) effect, little is known about spatial or temporal variability in plant response to the UHI. Using an automated temperature sensor network in conjunction with Landsat-derived remotely sensed estimates of start/end of the growing season, we investigate the impacts of the UHI on plant phenology in the city of Madison WI (USA) for the 2012-2014 growing seasons. Median urban growing season length (GSL) estimated from temperature sensors is similar to 5 d longer than surrounding rural areas, and UHI impacts on GSL are relatively consistent from year-to-year. Parks within urban areas experience a subdued expression of GSL lengthening resulting from interactions between the UHI and a park cool island effect. Across all growing seasons, impervious cover in the area surrounding each temperature sensor explains {\textgreater}50\% of observed variability in phenology. Comparisons between long-term estimates of annual mean phenological timing, derived from remote sensing, and temperature-based estimates of individual growing seasons show no relationship at the individual sensor level. The magnitude of disagreement between temperature-based and remotely sensed phenology is a function of impervious and grass cover surrounding the sensor, suggesting that realized GSL is controlled by both local land cover and micrometeorological conditions.},
