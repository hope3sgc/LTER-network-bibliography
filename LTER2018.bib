	abstract = {Land use conversions into and out of agriculture may influence soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes for many years. We tested the legacy effects of land use on cumulative soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes for 5 yr following conversion of 22-yr-old Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands and conventionally tilled agricultural fields (AGR) to continuous no-till corn, switchgrass, and restored prairie. An unconverted CRP field served as a reference. We assessed the labile soil C pool of the upper 10 cm in 2009 (the conversion year) and in 2014 using short-term soil incubations. We also measured in situ soil N2O fluxes biweekly from 2009 through 2014 using static chambers except when soils were frozen. The labile C pool was approximately twofold higher in soils previously in CRP than in those formerly in tilled cropland. Five-year cumulative soil N2O emissions were approximately threefold higher in the corn system on former CRP than on former cropland despite similar fertilization rates (similar to 184 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). The lower cumulative emissions from corn on former cropland were similar to emissions from switchgrass that was fertilized less (similar to 57 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)), regardless of former land use, and lowest emissions were observed from the unfertilized restored prairie and reference systems. Findings support the hypothesis that soil labile carbon levels modulate the response of soil N2O emissions to nitrogen inputs, with soils higher in labile carbon but otherwise similar, in this case reflecting land use history, responding more strongly to added nitrogen.},

	abstract = {The expansion of woody shrubs in arctic tundra alters many aspects of high-latitude ecosystems, including carbon cycling and wildlife habitat. Dendroecology, the study of annual growth increments in woody plants, has shown promise in revealing how climate and environmental conditions interact with shrub growth to affect these key ecosystem properties. However, a predictive understanding of how shrub growth response to climate varies across the heterogeneous landscape remains elusive. Here we use individual-based mixed effects modeling to analyze 19 624 annual growth ring measurements in the stems of Salix pulchra (Cham.), a rapidly expanding deciduous shrub. Stem samples were collected at six sites throughout the North Slope of Alaska. Sites spanned four landscapes that varied in time since glaciation and hence in soil properties, such as nutrient availability, that we expected would modulate shrub growth response to climate. Ring growth was remarkably coherent among sites and responded positively to mean June temperature. The strength of this climate response varied slightly among glacial landscapes, but in contrast to expectations, this variability was not systematically correlated with landscape age. Additionally, shrubs at all sites exhibited diminishing marginal growth gains in response to increasing temperatures, indicative of alternative growth limiting mechanisms in particularly warm years, such as temperature-induced moisture limitation. Our results reveal a regionally-coherent and robust shrub growth response to early season growing temperature, with local soil properties contributing only a minor influence on shrub growth. Our conclusions strengthen predictions of changes to wildlife habitat and improve the representation of tundra vegetation dynamics in earth systems models in response to future arctic warming.},

	abstract = {Storm events in montane catchments are the main cause of mobilization of solutes and particulates into and within stream channels in coastal California. Nonlinear behavior of nutrients and suspended sediments during storms is evident in the hysteresis that arises in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships. We examined patterns in the C-Q hysteresis of nutrients (NO3, NH4+, DON, and PO43) and total suspended solids (TSS) during storms across 10 sites and water years 2002-2015 by quantifying the slope of the C-Q relationship and the rotational pattern of the hysteresis loop. We observed several hysteresis types in the similar to 400 storms included in our study. Concentrations of constituents associated with sediment transport (PO43 and TSS) peaked during high flows. Conversely, nitrogen species had hysteretic responses such as dilution with clockwise rotation in urban sites and enrichment with anticlockwise rotation in undeveloped sites. The wide range of C-Q responses that occurred among sites and seasons reflected the variable hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics of catchments and storms. Responses for nitrate in nested catchments differed in slope and rotation of C-Q hysteresis. Upland undeveloped and lowland urban sites had anticlockwise rotation at the onset of the rainy season following a dry year, which implied a delay in the transport of this solute to the streams. Slopes by the middle of the rainy season showed that the urban site switched from dilution to enrichment, and then again to dilution with clockwise rotation at the end of the season, which implied high initial concentrations and proximal sources.},

The upland sandpiper Bartramia longicauda makes long-distance migrations twice a year, but variation in body condition or timing of feather molt during the non-breeding season has not been studied. Molt is an important part of the annual cycle of migratory birds because feather condition determines flight performance during migration, and long-distance movements are energetically costly. However, variation in body condition during molt has been poorly studied. The objective of our field study was to examine the timing and patterns of feather molt of a long distance migratory shorebird during the non-breeding season and test for relationships with body size, fat depots, mass, and sex. Field work was conducted at four ranches in the Northern Campos of Uruguay (Paysandu and Salto Departments). We captured and marked 62 sandpipers in a 2-month period (Nov-Jan) during four non-breeding seasons (2008-2012). Sex was determined by genetic analyses of blood samples taken at capture. Molt was measured in captured birds using rank scores based on published standards. Body mass and tarsus length measurements showed female-biased sexual size dimorphism with males smaller than females. Size-corrected body mass (body condition) showed a U-shaped relationship with the day of the season, indicating that birds arrived at non-breeding grounds in relatively good condition. Arriving in good body condition at non-breeding grounds is probably important because of the energetic demands due to physiological adjustments after migration and the costs of feather molt.},

This special issue is dedicated towards evaluating tropical dry forest resilience to such events in Mexico at the landscape, ecosystem, community and population levels. Collectively, the articles herein suggest that tropical dry forests are highly resilient to these extreme disturbances, at least in the short-term, because different patterns and processes across ecological levels can recover relatively quickly to pre-disturbance conditions. However, because forest recovery is strongly controlled by water availability, extreme dry years after disturbance may limit its resilience capacity. Understanding the precipitation regime in these seasonally dry forests will be crucial for improving their management as the frequency of extreme events increases. A common theme of several articles in this special issue is that resilience of tropical dry forests to the interacting effects of climatic and anthropogenic disturbances seems so far idiosyncratic and unpredictable and merits further research in the long-term.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the spatial distribution of ecological resources shapes species' diversity and abundance in human-modified landscapes is a central theme in conservation biology. However, studies often disregard that such patterns may vary over time, thereby potentially missing critical environmental constraints to species persistence. This may be particularly important in highly mobile species such as bats, which are able to track temporal variations in spatial resource distribution. Here we test the hypothesis that bats in Mediterranean landscapes are strongly affected by the progressive reduction in water availability during the seasonal summer drought. We analyzed the effects of landscape composition and structure on bat diversity and activity, during pregnancy, lactation, and postlactation periods, and identified the most influential variables within and across periods. Water bodies showed the strongest positive effect on bats, followed by riparian habitats and areas with steeper ({\textgreater}30\%) slopes. However, while during pregnancy, there were only small landscape effects, these increased during lactation and postlactation, highlighting a progressively stronger association with water habitats during the summer drought. The spatial projection of habitat models showed that the landscape distribution of bat diversity and activity hotspots changed markedly over time. During pregnancy, the spatial pattern of hotspot distribution was weakly defined, while during lactation and particularly postlactation, there was a concentration of hotspots along permanently flowing watercourses. Our study highlights that permanently flowing watercourses are critical for bat conservation in Mediterranean landscapes, calling for measures to counteract their ongoing degradation due in particular to climate change, water abstraction and damming. More generally, our study underlines the importance of considering the temporal dimension in habitat selection studies, without which there is the risk of overlooking the importance of habitats that are key for species persistence only at certain times of the year.},

In this paper we sought to understand the global drivers of plant stoichiometry and compare the relative contribution of climatic vs. anthropogenic effects. We addressed this goal by measuring plant elemental (C, N, P and K) responses to eutrophication and vertebrate herbivore exclusion at eighteen sites on six continents. Across sites, climate and atmospheric N deposition emerged as strong predictors of plot-level tissue nutrients, mediated by biomass and plant chemistry. Within sites, fertilization increased total plant nutrient pools, but results were contingent on soil fertility and the proportion of grass biomass relative to other functional types. Total plant nutrient pools diverged strongly in response to herbivore exclusion when fertilized; responses were largest in ungrazed plots at low rainfall, whereas herbivore grazing dampened the plant community nutrient responses to fertilization. Our study highlights (1) the importance of climate in determining plant nutrient concentrations mediated through effects on plant biomass, (2) that eutrophication affects grassland nutrient pools via both soil and atmospheric pathways and (3) that interactions among soils, herbivores and eutrophication drive plant nutrient responses at small scales, especially at water-limited sites.},

	abstract = {Climate change and consumer outbreaks are driving ecosystem collapse worldwide. Although much research has demonstrated that these factors can interact, how heterogeneity in top-down control intensity and physical forcing modulates ecosystem resilience to climate stress remains poorly understood. Here, we explore whether the nocturnal herbivorous crab Sesarma reticulatum can control spatially dominant cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) growth and how its top-down effects vary with crab density, drought stress, and large-scale disturbance in southeastern US salt marshes. In multiple field experiments and surveys, we show that Sesarma depresses cordgrass growth and that its effects increase in a saturating manner with increasing crab density, such that the highest naturally occurring densities of this consumer can trigger local cordgrass die-off. This top-down effect of Sesarma is similar in magnitude to what is thought to be the dominant grazer in the system, the marsh periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata. In a drought stress by Sesarma density experiment, we further show that salinity stress and intensive crab herbivory additively suppress cordgrass drought resistance. After drought subsides, surveys and experiments reveal that Sesarma also stifles cordgrass re-growth into existing die-off areas. Together, these results show that multiple grazers powerfully regulate the productivity and drought resilience of these intertidal grasslands and that heterogeneity in physical stress and consumer density can dictate when and where top-down forcing is important. More generally, this work provides a rare, experimental demonstration of the critical role top-down control can play across the initiation and recovery stages of ecosystem die-off.},

	abstract = {A simple bottom-up hypothesis predicts that plant responses to nutrient addition should determine the response of consumers: more productive and less diverse plant communities, the usual result of long-term nutrient addition, should support greater consumer abundances and biomass and less consumer diversity. We tested this hypothesis for the response of an aboveground arthropod community to an uncommonly long-term (24-year) nutrient addition experiment in moist acidic tundra in arctic Alaska. This experiment altered plant community composition, decreased plant diversity and increased plant production and biomass as a deciduous shrub, Betula nana, became dominant. Consistent with strong effects on the plant community, nutrient addition altered arthropod community composition, primarily through changes to herbivore taxa in the canopy-dwelling arthropod assemblage and detritivore taxa in the ground assemblage. Surprisingly, however, the loss of more than half of plant species was accompanied by negligible changes to diversity (rarefied richness) of arthropod taxa (which were primarily identified to family). Similarly, although long-term nutrient addition in this system roughly doubles plant production and biomass, arthropod abundance was either unchanged or decreased by nutrient addition, and total arthropod biomass was unaffected. Our findings differ markedly from the handful of terrestrial studies that have found bottom-up diversity cascades and productivity responses by consumers to nutrient addition. This is probably because unlike grasslands and salt marshes (where such studies have historically been conducted), this arctic tundra community becomes less palatable, rather than more so, after many years of nutrient addition due to increased dominance of B. nana. Additionally, by displacing insulating mosses and increasing the cover of shrubs that cool and shade the canopy microenvironment, fertilization may displace arthropods keenly attuned to microclimate. These results indicate that terrestrial arthropod assemblages may be more constrained by producer traits (i.e. palatability, structure) than they are by total primary production or producer diversity.},

This ambition to increase understanding and develop models of ESD based on site observations was the stimulus for creating the networks of Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs), and others. We organized a survey, the results of which identified pressing gaps in data availability from these networks, in particular for the future development and evaluation of models that represent ESD processes, and provide insights for improvement in both data collection and model integration. From this survey overview of data applications in the context of LTER and CZO research, we identified three challenges: (1) widen application of terrestrial observation network data in Earth system modelling, (2) develop integrated Earth system models that incorporate process representation and data of multiple disciplines, and (3) identify complementarily in measured variables and spatial extent, and promoting synergies in the existing observational networks. These challenges lead to perspectives and recommendations for an improved dialogue between the observation networks and the ESD modelling community, including co-location of sites in the existing networks and further formalizing these recommendations among these communities. Developing these synergies will enable cross-site and cross-network comparison and synthesis studies, which will help produce insights around organizing principles, classifications, and general rules of coupling processes with environmental conditions.},

The mechanisms are poorly understood, because the functional characteristics and abundances of tree species and AM fungi are likely to be codependent. We used generalized joint attribute modeling to evaluate if AM fungi are associated with three forest community metrics for a sub-tropical montane forest in Puerto Rico. The metrics chosen to reflect changes during forest succession are the abundance of seedlings of different successional status, the amount of foliar damage on seedlings of different successional status, and community-weighted mean functional trait values (adult specific leaf area [SLA], adult wood density, and seed mass). We used high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the soil. Model predictions showed that seedlings of mid- and late-successional species had less leaf damage when the 12 most common AM fungi were abundant compared to when these fungi were absent. We also found that seedlings of mid-successional species were predicted to be more abundant when the 12 most common AM fungi were abundant compared to when these fungi were absent. In contrast, early-successional tree seedlings were predicted to be less abundant when the 12 most common AM fungi were abundant compared to when these fungi were absent. Finally, we showed that, among the 12 most common AM fungi, different AM fungi were correlated with functional trait characteristics of early- or late-successional species. Together, these results suggest that early-successional species might not rely as much as mid- and late-successional species on AM fungi, and AM fungi might accelerate forest succession.},

	abstract = {Urban areas are highly fragmented and thereby exert strong constraints on individual dispersal. Despite this, some species manage to persist in urban areas, such as the garden snail, Cornu aspersum, which is common in cityscapes despite its low mobility. Using landscape genetic approaches, we combined study area replication and multiscale analysis to determine how landscape composition, configuration and connectivity influence snail dispersal across urban areas. At the overall landscape scale, areas with a high percentage of roads decreased genetic differentiation between populations. At the population scale, genetic differentiation was positively linked with building surface, the proportion of borders where wooded patches and roads appeared side by side and the proportion of borders combining wooded patches and other impervious areas. Analyses based on pairwise genetic distances validated the isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance models for this land snail, with an equal fit to least-cost paths and circuit-theory-based models. Each of the 12 landscapes analysed separately yielded specific relations to environmental features, whereas analyses integrating all replicates highlighted general common effects. Our results suggest that urban transport infrastructures facilitate passive snail dispersal. At a local scale, corresponding to active dispersal, unfavourable habitats (wooded and impervious areas) isolate populations. This work upholds the use of replicated landscapes to increase the generalizability of landscape genetics results and shows how multiscale analyses provide insight into scale-dependent processes.},

The biogeochemical fate of this overrun OM remains poorly understood, ultimately limiting our understanding of subglacial biogeochemical cycling, particularly for cold-based glaciers. This study presents evidence for the biogeochemical transformation of algal mat material that was overrun by a cold-based glacier (Suess Glacier, Taylor Valley, Antarctica) during its advance 4840-3570 years BP. We use a suite of stable isotope analyses to show that active nitrogen cycling has depleted N-isotope values to amongst the lowest reported in Taylor Valley (-15.59 parts per thousand) from an initial value of similar to-1.88 parts per thousand, while potentially depleting C-isotope values by 2.46 parts per thousand. While this study examines biogeochemical conditions beneath a single glacier, all glaciers export meltwater during the melt season that may host algae and other OM in proglacial streams and lakes that may be overridden during glacier advance. As such, subglacial nitrogen cycling detected here may represent processes that occur in cold zones beneath glaciers generally.},

In the ocean, the chlorophyll a to carbon ratio (Chl:C) has been used as a proxy for the physiological condition of phytoplankton, and there is laboratory evidence that the growth rate of juvenile giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), a coastal foundation species, is positively related to Chl:C under nutrient-limited conditions. We examined the relative roles of nutrients and light in determining Chl:C dynamics and if fluctuations in Chl:C were related to changes in canopy biomass and net primary production (NPP) from sites spanning 750 km of the California coast. Seventy percent of the variability in canopy Chl:C was explained by a combination of photosynthetically active radiation and seawater nitrate concentration. In the periodically nutrient-limited waters of the Southern California Bight, changes in Chl:C positively resembled changes in available nitrate, whereas Chl:C negatively tracked changes in light for the more nutrient-replete central California coastline. Values of Chl:C were positively related to residuals from an autoregressive model of kelp biomass at the southern California sites indicating that Chl:C is a proxy for physiological state of the kelp canopy. NPP estimated through correlations with kelp biomass and lagged Chl:C compared well to established field-based estimates. These results open the possibility of assessing giant kelp physiological condition from estimates of Chl:C modeled from sea surface irradiance and nitrate concentration, which in turn can be used to estimate giant kelp primary production over large spatial and temporal scales using future remote sensing technologies.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been increasing in many north temperate and boreal lakes for over two decades. The concentration of DOM in lakes is influenced by a number of environmental factors, but there is still considerable debate about how the availability of terrestrial DOM, and associated dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, may be affected by drivers of climatic change. Using experimental and observational methods, we considered how changes in soil temperature and moisture affected the composition of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus entering freshwater lakes. In our experiment, organic soil cores were collected from the wetland shoreline of a darkly-stained seepage lake in northern Wisconsin, USA and manipulated in laboratory with temperature and moisture treatments. During the 28-day study, soil leachate was sampled and analyzed for optical properties of DOM via UV/Vis absorbance, as well as concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen, and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). DOM optical properties were particularly sensitive to moisture, with drier scenarios resulting in DOM of lower molecular weight and aromaticity. Warmer temperatures led to lower DOC and TDP concentrations. To consider long-term relationships between climate and lake chemical properties, we analyzed long-term water chemistry data from two additional Wisconsin lakes from the long term ecological research (LTER) project in a cross correlation analysis with Palmer drought severity index data. Analysis of the LTER data supported our experimental results that soil moisture has a significant effect on the quality of DOM entering lakes and that climate may significantly affect lake chemical properties. Although unexpected in terms of DOM loading for climate change scenarios, these results are consistent with patterns of decomposition in organic soils and may be attributed to an increase in soil DOM processing.},

	abstract = {In marine ecosystems, many planktonic organisms precipitate biogenic silica (bSiO(2)) to build silicified skeletons. Among them, giant siliceous rhizarians ({\textgreater}500 mu m), including Radiolaria and Phaeodaria, are important contributors to oceanic carbon pools but little is known about their contribution to the marine silica cycle. We report the first analyses of giant phaeodarians to bSiO(2) export in the California Current Ecosystem. We measured the silica content of single rhizarian cells ranging in size from 470 to 3,920 mu m and developed allometric equations to predict silica content (0.37-43.42 mu g Si/cell) from morphometric measurements. Using sediment traps to measure phaeodarian fluxes from the euphotic zone on four cruises, we calculated bSiO(2) export produced by two families, the Aulosphaeridae and Castanellidae. Biogenic silica export ranged from {\textless}0.01 to 0.63 mmol Si.m(-2).day(-1). These two families alone contributed on average 10\% (range 0-80\%) of total bSiO(2) export from the euphotic zone. Their proportional contributions increased substantially in more oligotrophic regions with lower bSiO(2) fluxes. Using the in situ Underwater Vision Profiler 5, we characterized vertical distributions of the giant phaeodarian family Aulosphaeridae to a depth of 500 m and inferred their contribution to bSiO(2) export in deeper waters. We found a significant increase of Aulosphaeridae export ({\textless}0.01 to 2.82 mmol Si.m(-2).day(-1)) when extended to mesopelagic depths. Using a global data set of in situ profiles, we estimated the significance of Aulosphaeridae to bSiO(2) export and revealed that they can act as major exporters of bSiO(2) to the mesopelagic zone in various regions.},

	abstract = {The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) literature provides strong evidence of the biophysical basis for the potential profitability of greater diversity but does not address questions of optimal management. BEF studies typically focus on the ecosystem outputs produced by randomly assembled communities that only differ in their biodiversity levels, measured by indices such as species richness. Landholders, however, do not randomly select species to plant; they choose particular species that collectively maximize profits. As such, their interest is not in comparing the average performance of randomly assembled communities at each level of biodiversity but rather comparing the best-performing communities at each diversity level. Assessing the best-performing mixture requires detailed accounting of species' identities and relative abundances. It also requires accounting for the financial cost of individual species' seeds, and the economic value of changes in the quality, quantity, and variability of the species' collective output-something that existing multifunctionality indices fail to do. This study presents an assessment approach that integrates the relevant factors into a single, coherent framework. It uses ecological production functions to inform an economic model consistent with the utilitymaximizing decisions of a potentially risk-averse private landowner. We demonstrate the salience and applicability of the framework using data from an experimental grassland to estimate production relationships for hay and carbon storage. For that case, our results suggest that even a risk-neutral, profit-maximizing landowner would favor a highly diverse mix of species, with optimal species richness falling between the low levels currently found in commercial grasslands and the high levels found in natural grasslands.},

	abstract = {Overstory forest structure responds to terrain-related abiotic factors and to biotic interactions among overstory and understory plants. Unlike species abundance, tree height, biomass, and leaf area in many regions have been poorly quantified in relation to terrain-driven environmental gradients. In addition, the magnitude of understory influences on overstory structure has been poorly characterized for many forest systems. Our primary goal was to identify relationships between terrain (elevation, convexity, exposure), evergreen understory, and overstory structure (height, aboveground biomass, leaf area) in mature deciduous forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains. We used a combination of field point and plot measurements, LiDAR, and satellite image data to sample little-disturbed deciduous forest stands. Height, biomass, and gap frequency were significantly related to changes in elevation, exposure (aspect), and convexity (cove to ridge). Higher evergreen understory density was strongly correlated with decreases in forest height and biomass, with an impact observed across moisture, elevation, and exposure gradients. Canopies on ridges averaged half as tall at the highest evergreen understory densities when compared to those without evergreen shrubs (10 vs. 19 m), and overstory canopy height averaged 6 m shorter on sideslopes with high evergreen understory density compared to those with low evergreen understory density. Canopy height declined from low to high elevations, with larger relative decreases on ridges, but biomass increased from low to high elevations, due primarily to high biomass in coves at mid-to upper elevations. Biomass and canopy height declined from cove to ridge and north-to south-facing slopes. Responses in canopy height and aboveground biomass associated with changes in understory evergreen density were similar to impacts due to terrain. Gaps were more frequent on south-facing slopes. Previous studies at this site and others identify soil moisture and soil N competition as the most plausible mechanisms by which understory shrubs might influence overstory canopy structure, with low light limiting seedling recruitment as an additional mechanism. Our work suggests evergreen understory density, particularly on sideslope and ridge locations, substantially affects overstory canopy height and biomass.},

	abstract = {Deforestation to establish monocrops in the tropics is causing massive reductions in ecosystem C stocks, Amazonia is a principal targets of this process, owing to the expansion of the agribusiness frontier throughout the transition with the Cerrado biome, the zone known as the "Arc of Deforestation". In this vast contact region between the two largest South American biomes, the conversion of primary forest to soybean and pasture systems has led to the deforestation of nearly five million hectares since 1980. Despite this, we lack precise understanding of the effects of land use on ecosystem C stocks and pools in this region. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial to improve predictions and fit models for different land use scenarios in Amazonia. To reduce uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the impacts of deforestation on the C cycle, we evaluated ecosystem C stocks in contrasting land-use systems across a topographically, climatically, and edaphically near-homogeneous landscape in southern Amazonia. We investigated the soil, litter, fine root and aboveground biomass (AGB) C stocks of soybean plantations and compared them to those of remnant native forests and rubber plantations; the latter is considered a priori as a cropping system with low impact on the C cycle. We found that the conversion of native forest to soybean plantation caused a 130.5 Mg C ha(-1) loss, about threefold higher than the loss when forest is converted to rubber plantations, 48.5 Mg C ha(-1). While 30-year old rubber plantations had recovered 84\% of forest carbon stocks, all plantation types induced sustained losses of at least one-third of the original soil carbon. Fine root allocation changed sharply in the two crops following conversion, indicating an alteration in plant nutrient dynamics. Our results show that perennial and annual monocrops have very different impacts on the C cycle, which need to be accounted for in carbon-climate models as well as in public policies regulating land use in Amazonia. Our results show that while silviculture has the potential to restore most of the above-ground C stocks of previously forested areas, but neither silviculture nor conventional agriculture may ever restore Amazon soil C stocks once they become vulnerable and oxidized after deforestation. If such conversion-driven soil carbon losses were scaled across the Amazon they would induce a cumulative loss of more than 5 Pg in soil carbon by 2050.},

Regional climate change is significantly altering the patterns and magnitudes of this dynamism with cascading impacts on biogeochemistry, productivity, and food web architecture. Isoscapes (or isotopic maps) provide a valuable analytical framework to characterize ecosystem processes and address questions about trophic dynamics, animal movement, and elemental cycling. Applications of stable isotope methods to Antarctic ecosystems are currently limited by a paucity of information on geospatial isotope characteristics within the Southern Ocean. In response, we have created the first empirically derived zooplankton isoscapes for West Antarctica based on analysis of bulk nitrogen and carbon isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in 94 zooplankton specimens from the Drake Passage, West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), and Amundsen and Ross Seas. The zooplankton delta N-15 values increased by 3\% from north of the Polar Front (3.3 +/- 0.6\%, mean +/- SD) to the Ross Sea (6.2 +/- 0.8\%), reflecting a productivity gradient across this region. Abundant open water polynyas in the Amundsen and Ross Seas exhibit strong nitrate drawdown, resulting in more N-15-enriched phytoplankton and zooplankton relative to those from the generally less productive WAP and Drake Passage. Zooplankton delta C-13 values decreased by 3\% from north of the Polar Front (-24.2 +/- 0.9\%) to the Ross Sea (-27.5 +/- 1.6\%), likely driven by decreasing sea surface temperatures with increasing latitude. Our isoscapes are a valuable first step in establishing isotopic spatial patterns in West Antarctica and are critical for addressing numerous ecosystem questions.},

This schematic representation allows the characterization of the most important compartments of biomass and flows of energy representing the functioning of the ecosystem, and can be used in the fields of decision-making and management. The model considered 26 functional groups from primary producers to top-predators and two different fisheries (artisanal and leisure), and showed that Ria de Aveiro is a dynamic ecosystem dominated by a high biomass of primary producers, where the transference of energy among compartments is, to a large extent, accomplished through the detritus path. The model also provides several ecological indicators on the state of maturity of the ecosystem, showing that Ria de Aveiro is in an intermediate state of maturity with a relatively complex food web and resilience to environmental changes. As discussed, this state of maturity is probably determined by human action pervading the system to advance in the expectable ecological succession of a coastal lagoon. These aspects, together with indicators of elevated fishing pressure and predation within the system, underline the necessity of controlling illegal extraction activities and monitoring the biomass of the main functional groups of the system, especially top predators, in order to keep the functioning of the ecosystem of Ria de Aveiro in its current condition.},

	abstract = {Precipitation changes the physiological characteristics of an ecosystem. Because land-surface models are often used to project changes in the hydrological cycle, modeling the effect of precipitation on the latent heat flux lambda E is an important aspect of land-surface models. Here we contrast conditionally sampled diel composites of the eddy-covariance fluxes from the Niwot Ridge Subalpine Forest AmeriFlux tower with the Community Land Model (CLM, version 4.5). With respect to measured lambda E during the warm season: for the day following above-average precipitation, lambda E was enhanced at midday by approximate to 40 W m(-2) (relative to dry conditions), and nocturnal lambda E increased from approximate to 10 W m(-2) in dry conditions to over 20 W m(-2) in wet conditions. With default settings, CLM4.5 did not successfully model these changes. By increasing the amount of time that rainwater was retained by the canopy/needles, CLM was able to match the observed midday increase in lambda E on a dry day following a wet day. Stable nighttime conditions were problematic for CLM4.5. Nocturnal CLM lambda E had only a small (approximate to 3 W m(-2)) increase during wet conditions, CLM nocturnal friction velocity u(*) was smaller than observed u(*), and CLM canopy air temperature was 2 degrees C less than those measured at the site. Using observed u(*) as input to CLM increased lambda E; however, this caused CLM lambda E to be increased during both wet and dry periods. We suggest that sloped topography and the ever-present drainage flow enhanced nocturnal u(*) and lambda E. Such phenomena would not be properly captured by topographically blind land-surface models, such as CLM.},

This study examines the changing patterns of daily precipitation at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, USA, since 1937 for four rain gauges across a range of elevations. We analyse seasonal total rainfall, number of rain days and the frequency of heavy rainfall. We compare these with several teleconnections, including the Bermuda High Index (BHI), the West BHI, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Our data show a tendency for increased variability, including major periods of drought, with fewer rain days recently, especially in summer. Only autumn tended to have increases in rainfall frequency and magnitude; this is the season when orographic enhancement is at its strongest. The major driver of precipitation at Coweeta is the strength of the Bermuda High. The strength of the NAO is important in summer. The results are relevant to the southeast United States in general, given that the region comes under the influence of similar air masses during the year. The findings are applicable to the wider Appalachian Mountains and to other mountainous regions where there is significant orographic enhancement.},

	abstract = {Patterned vegetation growth such as grass rings is found in many arid ecosystems, yet the mechanisms behind their formation are often unknown and have been minimally tested in the field. One explanation is pathogen accumulation in the center of a long-lived plant, which could cause central dieback and the formation of a ring as the plant grows toward pathogen-free soil. We tested this mechanism by comparing the growth of blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) in live and sterilized soils from inside or outside naturally occurring grass rings. Field collected roots from the inner edge of grass rings had higher fungal colonization than roots from the outer edge, suggesting the potential for intensified pathogen interactions on the inside of rings. However, while plants grown in live soils performed worse than those in sterile soils, this pathogenic effect did not differ between soils collected from inside versus outside of grass rings. Further work on the spatial distribution of plant-microbe interactions is needed to confirm their direct role in ring formation. Our findings suggest that soil and root microbes, in addition to known mechanisms such as soil hydrology, potentially promote ring formation of a widespread North American grass species.},

Using flumes (5.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 m) located outdoors in Moorea, French Polynesia, we assembled local back reef communities with similar to 25\% coral cover, and tested their response to pCO(2) levels of 344, 633, 870 and 1146 mu atm. Incubations began in late Austral spring (November 2015), and net community calcification (G(net)) and net community primary production (P-net) were measured prior to treatments, 24 h after treatment began, and biweekly or monthly thereafter until early Austral autumn (March 2016). G(net) was depressed under elevated pCO(2) over 4 months, although the magnitude of the response varied over time. The proportional decline in G(net) as a function of saturation state of aragonite (Omega(ar)) depended on the initial Omega(ar), but was 24\% for a decline in Omega(ar) from 4.0 to 3.0, which is nearly twice as sensitive to variation in Omega(ar) than the previously published values for the net calcification of ex situ coral colonies. However, community G(net) was less sensitive to Omega(ar) than coral reefs that have been analyzed in situ. P-net was unaffected by pCO(2), but P-net and G(net) expressed on a hourly time base were positively associated, thus revealing the tight coupling between these metabolic processes. The high sensitivity of Gnet to pCO(2) for the back reef of Moorea, versus lower sensitivity of individual coral colony calcification to pCO(2), underscores the challenges of scaling-up experimental results on the effects of pCO(2) from coral reef organisms to coral reef communities.},

Mature limber pines (Pinus flexilis) host a core microbiome of acetic acid bacteria in their foliage, but the bacterial endophyte community structure, variation, and assembly across tree ontogeny is unknown. The aims of this study were to test if the core microbiome observed in adult P. flexilis is established at the seedling stage, if seedlings host different endophyte communities in root and shoot tissues, and how environmental factors structure seedling endophyte communities. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to characterize the bacterial endophyte communities in roots and shoots of P. flexilis seedlings grown in plots at three elevations at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, subjected to experimental treatments (watering and heating). The data was compared to previously sequenced endophyte communities from adult tree foliage sampled in the same year and location. Seedling shoots hosted a different core microbiome than adult tree foliage and were dominated by a few OTUs in the family Oxalobacteraceae, identical or closely related to strains with antifungal activity. Shoot and root communities significantly differed from each other but shared major OTUs. Watering but not warming restructured the seedling endophyte communities. The results suggest differences in assembly and ecological function across conifer life stages. Seedlings may recruit endophytes to protect against fungi under increased soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) availability is a driver of soil microbial diversity and function, and is affected by prescribed burning (N removal through volatilization) and fertilization (N addition). Because soil microbes control critical feedbacks to ecosystem function, it is important to understand the dynamics and responses of microbial populations under conditions of contrasting N availability. This study took place at a long-term field manipulation in which native tallgrass prairie was annually burned or not burned, and annually fertilized or not fertilized, in a factorial design, since 1986. Composite surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected monthly between November 2014 and December 2015 from replicate plots to evaluate event-based (post-fire, post-fertilization), seasonal, and long-term responses of soil microbial communities to management and environmental changes. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS population sizes were estimated using qPCR, and bacterial community composition (BCC) was measured using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. We expected seasonal and event-based change in all parameters, and that total microbial population sizes and diversity would be lower in soils with higher N availability, due to greater competitive dominance of nitrophilic or copiotrophic taxa. Bacterial and fungal population sizes varied significantly by sampling month, in that bacterial populations were approximately 10 x greater in summer (June-August), but did not change in response to management events or long-term treatments. In contrast, very few individual taxonomic groups displayed seasonal or event-based responses, and there was no significant whole-community turnover on weekly or monthly time-scales; instead, BCC was strongly impacted by both the long-term fire and fertilization treatments. Specifically, there were increases and decreases in putatively "copiotrophic" and "oligotrophic" prokaryotic Phyla in response to long-term N fertilization, which were significantly stronger and more predictable in soils following long-term fire suppression. These results reveal that while long-term grassland management changes BCC beyond the detected range of seasonal variability, total bacterial populations change coherently month-to-month, potentially due to significant plant inputs of labile carbon during the growing season. Furthermore, because prescribed burning reduces soil N availability, the interactive responses to fire suppression plus fertilization suggest that higher background levels of soil N availability may increase the magnitude of soil microbial sensitivity to N fertilization.},

	abstract = {Coastal bays and, specifically, back-barrier tidal basins host productive ecosystems, coastal communities, and critical infrastructure. As sea level continues to rise and tropical cyclones increase in intensity, these coastal systems are increasingly at risk. Developing a sediment budget is imperative to understanding how storm events affect the system's resilience, where net import of sediment indicates growth and resilience against sea level rise, and net export of sediment indicates deterioration. Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we show that intense storms import sediment into a system of bays in Virginia, USA. Duration and magnitude of storm surge are among the most important factors in sediment import, suggesting that intense storms increase the stability of tidal bays by providing the sediment necessary to counteract sea level rise. Since climate models project that tropical cyclones will increase in intensity in coming decades, our results have significant implications for the resilience of tidal bays and the future of coastal communities worldwide. Plain Language Summary In order to counteract rising sea levels, a coastal bay needs to increase its bottom elevation by trapping enough sediment in salt marshes and tidal flats. People believe that storms are deleterious to coastal bays, but this is not necessarily true. In many coastal settings, intense storms are the main mechanism providing coastal bays with the sediments necessary to offset sea level rise. Here we show that intense storms provide sediments to the bay and marsh systems of the Virginia coastal bays, USA, thereby increasing their long-term stability.},

	abstract = {The global carbon cycle is strongly controlled by the source/sink strength of vegetation as well as the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to retain this carbon. These dynamics, as well as processes such as the mixing of old and newly fixed carbon, have been studied using ecosystem models, but different assumptions regarding the carbon allocation strategies and other model structures may result in highly divergent model predictions. We assessed the influence of three different carbon allocation schemes on the C cycling in vegetation. First, we described each model with a set of ordinary differential equations. Second, we used published measurements of ecosystem C compartments from the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site to find suitable parameters for the different model structures. And third, we calculated C stocks, release fluxes, radiocarbon values (based on the bomb spike), ages, and transit times. We obtained model simulations in accordance with the available data, but the time series of C in foliage and wood need to be complemented with other ecosystem compartments in order to reduce the high parameter collinearity that we observed, and reduce model equifinality. Although the simulated C stocks in ecosystem compartments were similar, the different model structures resulted in very different predictions of age and transit time distributions. In particular, the inclusion of two storage compartments resulted in the prediction of a system mean age that was 12-20 years older than in the models with one or no storage compartments. The age of carbon in the wood compartment of this model was also distributed towards older ages, whereas fast cycling compartments had an age distribution that did not exceed 5 years. As expected, models with C distributed towards older ages also had longer transit times. These results suggest that ages and transit times, which can be indirectly measured using isotope tracers, serve as important diagnostics of model structure and could largely help to reduce uncertainties in model predictions. Furthermore, by considering age and transit times of C in vegetation compartments as distributions, not only their mean values, we obtain additional insights into the temporal dynamics of carbon use, storage, and allocation to plant parts, which not only depends on the rate at which this C is transferred in and out of the compartments but also on the stochastic nature of the process itself.},

	abstract = {Understanding how factors that vary in spatial scale relate to population abundance is vital to forecasting species responses to environmental change. Stream and river ecosystems are inherently hierarchical, potentially resulting in organismal responses to fine-scale changes in patch characteristics that are conditional on the watershed context. Here, we address how populations of two salamander species are affected by interactions among hierarchical processes operating at different scales within a rapidly changing landscape of the southern Appalachian Mountains. We modeled reach-level occupancy of larval and adult black-bellied salamanders (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) and larval Blue Ridge two-lined salamanders (Eurycea wilderae) as a function of 17 different terrestrial and aquatic predictor variables that varied in spatial extent. We found that salamander occurrence varied widely among streams within fully forested catchments, but also exhibited species-specific responses to changes in local conditions. While D. quadramaculatus declined predictably in relation to losses in forest cover, larval occupancy exhibited the strongest negative response to forest loss as well as decreases in elevation. Conversely, occupancy of E. wilderae was unassociated with watershed conditions, only responding negatively to higher proportions of fast-flowing stream habitat types. Evaluation of hierarchical relationships demonstrated that most fine-scale variables were closely correlated with broad watershed-scale variables, suggesting that local reach-scale factors have relatively smaller effects within the context of the larger landscape. Our results imply that effective management of southern Appalachian stream salamanders must first focus on the larger scale condition of watersheds before management of local-scale conditions should proceed. Our findings confirm the results of some studies while refuting the results of others, which may indicate that prescriptive recommendations for range-wide management of species or the application of a single management focus across large geographic areas is inappropriate.},

However, studies integrating the effects of TCs on both social and ecological systems are rare, especially in the northwest Pacific, where the frequency of TCs (locally named typhoons) is the highest in the world. We synthesized studies of effects of recurrent typhoons on social and ecological systems in Taiwan over the last several decades. Many responses to TCs are comparable between social and ecological systems. High forest ecosystem resistance, evident from tree mortality below 2\% even following multiple strong typhoons, is comparable with resistance of social systems, including the only 4\% destruction of river embankments following a typhoon that brought nearly 3000mm rainfall in three days. High resilience as reflected by quick returns of leaf area index, mostly in one year, and streamwater chemistry, one to several weeks to pre-typhoon levels of ecosystems, are comparable to quick repair of the power grid within one to several days and returns of vegetable price within several weeks to pre-typhoon levels of the social systems. Landslides associated with intense typhoons have buried mountain villages and transported large quantities of woody debris to the coast, affecting the coastal plains and reefs, illustrating a ridge-to-reef link between ecological and societal systems. Metrics of both social and ecological function showed large fluctuations in response to typhoons but quickly returned to pre-disturbance levels, except when multiple intense typhoons occurred within a single season. Our synthesis illustrates that the social-ecological systems in Taiwan are highly dynamic and responsive to frequent typhoon disturbance, with extraordinarily high resistance and resilience. For ecosystems, the efficient responsiveness results from the selective force of TCs on ecosystem structure and processes. For social systems, it is the result of the effects of TCs on planning and decision making by individuals (e.g., farmers), management sectors, and ultimately the government. In regions with frequent TCs, the social-ecological systems are inevitably highly dynamic and rapid responses are fundamental to system resistance and resilience which in turn is key to maintaining structure and function of the social-ecological systems.},

These eddies contribute to intense, long-distance cross-shelf transport of upwelled water with enhanced biological activity. However, the mechanisms of formation of such coastal eddies, and more importantly their capacity to trap and transport tracers, are poorly understood. Their unpredictability and strong dynamics leave us with an incomplete picture of the physical and biological processes at work, their effects on coastal export, lateral water exchange among eddies and their surrounding waters, and how long and how far these eddies remain coherent structures. Focusing our analysis on the southern part of the CCS, we find a predominance of cyclonic eddies, with a 25-km radius and a SSH amplitude of 6 cm. They are formed near shore and travel slightly northwest offshore for similar to 190 days at similar to 2 km day(-1). We then study one particular, representative cyclonic eddy using a combined Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical approach to characterize its kinematics. Formed near shore, this eddy trapped a core made up of similar to 67\% California Current waters and similar to 33\% California Undercurrent waters. This core was surrounded by other waters while the eddy detached from the coast, leaving the oldest waters at the eddy's core and the younger waters toward the edge. The eddy traveled several months as a coherent structure, with only limited lateral exchange within the eddy.},

	abstract = {Southern Appalachian riparian forests have undergone changes in composition and function from invasive pathogens and pests. Castanea dentata mortality in the 1930s from chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) and Tsuga canadensis mortality in the 2000s from the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) have led to the expansion and increased growth of Rhododendron maximum, an evergreen subcanopy shrub. A better understanding of seed bank characteristics and the various abiotic and biotic factors that affect the seed bank may be useful in determining the restoration potential of forest communities following invasion-related disturbances. We compared the seed bank of two deciduous forest types: hardwood forests with a dense R. maximum subcanopy (hereafter, RR) and hardwood forests without R. maximum (hereafter, HWD). We evaluated numerous microenvironmental variables through principal component analysis (PCA) and correlated the derived PCA axes scores to seed bank density and richness across forest types. We found that seed bank density was comparable between the forests types; however, seed bank richness was much lower in RR than HWD and the species composition was dissimilar between forest types. Twenty-eight of 64 (44\%) species in the seed bank of HWD were not found in the seed bank of RR. Species that were represented in both forest types were often found in contrasting densities. Most notably, seed bank densities of several woody species were considerably higher in RR (85\%) than HWD (45\%), while herbaceous seed bank density was lower in RR (11\%) than HWD (50\%). Mineral soil pH, soil nutrient availability, and soil moisture were lower, and organic soil (Oi + Oe + Oa) depth and mass were greater in the RR than HWD forest type. PCA correlations revealed that PCA4 (represented by understory density and Oe + Oa phosphorus and carbon/nitrogen ratio) was negatively correlated with total seed bank density. PCA1 (represented by Oe + Oa cations and phosphorus, understory richness, ground-layer cover, and mineral soil pH) and PCA4 were positively correlated with total seed bank richness. These results suggest that the soil seed bank will not be the primary mode of recruitment to establish a diverse and herbaceous-rich community if a RR is present.},

	abstract = {Worldwide the coastal land-sea interface is increasingly subject to natural and anthropogenic hazards. Monitoring this crucial interface may be addressed with satellite imagery as a cost-efficient mapping solution. Topography and bathymetry, defining the structural complexity of the coast, are commonly studied separately given specific thematic and methodological contexts, yet many science questions and societal challenges require an integrated approach (e.g., coastal inundation). In such cases, triplet multispectral imagery represents an affordable solution based on a single satellite product. Here we examine how Pleiades-1 triplet imagery may be used to retrieve a seamless and accurate topobathymetry digital surface model (DSM, from -20 to 1207 m) over an entire, socio-ecologically complex island: Moorea, French Polynesia. Creation of the topography DSMs was based on stereo and tri-stereo photogrammetry, and the bathymetry DSMs relied on quasi-nadiral multispectral data subject to light/water interaction modelling. Results were compared with over 3.9 million airborne LiDAR topobathymetry measurements to quantify how the spatio-spectral mode, the third imagery, and the level of radiometric correction act on two-and three-dimensional accuracy. Horizontal accuracy of the tri-stereo panchromatic dataset (E-RMSE = 4.22 and N-RMSE = 7.59 m) was better than the multispectral (E-RMSE = 5.06 and N-RMSE = 7.51 m) dataset. Topography point cloud density increased by a factor of three in the tri-stereo panchromatic (9.11 points/m(2)) or multispectral (0.23 points/m(2)) datasets. Topography vertical accuracy enhanced with tri-stereo + level-1 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.40 m) for panchromatic and with stereo + level-1/-2 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.77/7.77 m) as well as tri-stereo without radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.85 m) for multispectral datasets. Bathymetry vertical accuracy improved with level-2 (atmospheric) correction (RMSE = 0.83 m). Topobathymetry DSM derived from this optimized method has a wide spectrum of applications along coastal margins.},

	abstract = {The seasonal depletion of stratospheric ozone over the Southern Hemisphere allows abnormally high doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) to reach surface waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the austral spring, creating a natural laboratory for the study of lipid photooxidation in the shallow mixed layer of the marginal ice zone. The photooxidation of lipids under such conditions has been identified as a significant source of stress to microorganisms and short-chain fatty acids altered by photochemical processes have been found in both marine aerosols and sinking marine particle material. However, the biogeochemical impact of lipid photooxidation has not been quantitatively compared at ecosystem scale to the many other biological and abiotic processes that can transform particulate organic matter in the surface ocean. We combined results from field experiments with diverse environmental data, including high-resolution, accurate-mass HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of lipid extracts and in situ measurements of ultraviolet irradiance, to address several unresolved questions about lipid photooxidation in the marine environment. In our experiments, we used liposomes-nonliving, cell-like aggregations of lipids-to examine the photolability of various moieties of the intact polar diacylglycerol (IP-DAG) phosphatidylcholine (PC), a structural component of membranes in a broad range of microorganisms. We observed significant rates of photooxidation only when the molecule contained the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). As the DHA-containing lipid was oxidized, we observed the steady ingrowth of a diversity of oxylipins and oxidized IP-DAG; our results suggest both the intact IP-DAG the degradation products were amenable to heterotrophic assimilation. To complement our experiments, we used an enhanced version of a new lipidomics discovery software package to identify the lipids in water column samples and in several diatom isolates. The galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) and the phospholipids PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) accounted for the majority of IP-DAG in the water column particulate ({\textgreater}= 0.2 mm) size fraction; between 3.4 and 5.3\% of the IP-DAG contained fatty acids that were both highly polyunsaturated (i.e., each containing {\textgreater}= 5 double bonds). Using a broadband apparent quantum yield (AQY) that accounted for direct and Type I (i.e., radical- mediated) photooxidation of PUFA-containing IP-DAG, we estimated that 0.7 + 0.2 mmol IP- DAG m(-2) d(-1) (0.5 +/- 0.1 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) were oxidized by photochemical processes in the mixed layer. This rate represented 4.4\% (range, 3-21\%) of the mean bacterial production rate measured in the same waters immediately following the retreat of the sea ice. Because our liposome experiments were not designed to account for oxidation by Type II photosensitized processes that often dominate in marine phytodetritus, our rate estimates may represent a sizeable underestimate of the true rate of lipid photooxidation in the water column. While production of such diverse oxidized lipids and oxylipins has been previously observed in terrestrial plants and mammals in response to biological stressors such as disease, we show here that a similar suite of molecules can be produced via an abiotic process in the environment and that the effect can be commensurate in magnitude with other ecosystem-scale biogeochemical processes.

We characterize potential loads of nitrogen and phosphorus to seepage lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA, based on a laboratory soil leaching experiment and a model that includes landscape cover and watershed area. In these seepage lakes, nutrient concentrations are positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentrations (nitrogen: r=0.68, phosphorus: r=0.54). Using long-term records of browning, we found that dissolved organic matter-associated nutrient loadings may have resulted in substantial increases in nitrogen and phosphorus in seepage lakes and could account for currently observed nutrient concentrations in the lake. Silent nutrient loadings to brown-water lakes may lead to future water-quality concerns.},

	abstract = {The linking of individual functional traits to ecosystem processes is the basis for making generalizations in ecology, but the measurement of individual values is laborious and time consuming, preventing large-scale trait mapping. Also, in hyper-diverse systems, errors occur because identification is difficult, and species level values ignore intra-specific variation. To allow extensive trait mapping at the individual level, we evaluated the potential of Fourrier-Transformed Near Infra-Red Spectrometry (FT-NIR) to adequately describe 14 traits that are key for plant carbon, water, and nutrient balance. FT-NIR absorption spectra (1,000-2,500 nm) were obtained from dry leaves and branches of 1,324 trees of 432 species from a hyper-diverse Amazonian forest. FT-NIR spectra were related to measured traits for the same plants using partial least squares regressions. A further 80 plants were collected from a different site to evaluate model applicability across sites. Relative prediction error (RMSErel) was calculated as the percentage of the trait value range represented by the final model RMSE. The key traits used in most functional trait studies; specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, wood density and wood dry matter content can be well predicted by the model (R-2=0.69-0.78, RMSErel=9-11\%), while leaf density, xylem proportion, bark density and bark dry matter content can be moderately well predicted (R-2=0.53-0.61, RMSErel=14-17\%). Community-weighted means of all traits were well estimated with NIR, as did the shape of the frequency distribution of the community values for the above key traits. The model developed at the core site provided good estimations of the key traits of a different site. An evaluation of the sampling effort indicated that 400 or less individuals may be sufficient for establishing a good local model. We conclude that FT-NIR is an easy, fast and cheap method for the large-scale estimation of individual plant traits that was previously impossible. The ability to use dry intact leaves and branches unlocks the potential for using herbarium material to estimate functional traits; thus advancing our knowledge of community and ecosystem functioning from local to global scales.},

Both man-made and natural floods can cause pulses with varying intensity and duration. Here, we test the hypothesis that ostracod communities in the pleuston of floating plants are persistent during regular pulses and more variable during extreme floods. Ostracod communities were monitored in the Manezinho Backwater of the Upper Parana River floodplain (Brazil) for 83 months (seven hydrologic cycles). Flood pulses directly influenced the abiotic variables, which in turn were correlated with the species composition and abundance of ostracods. Variability in the species composition differentiated only between the limnophase of cycle 4 (L4: 2009) and the subsequent extreme flood of cycle 5 (P5: 2009-2010). The longer duration and higher intensity of the extreme flood can increase the exchange of organisms through the aquatic connections between the lake and the river and can potentially trigger the hatching of dry-resistant eggs, increasing variability in ostracod species composition. The absence of significant differences in the species composition variability between the other succeeding periods shows that these communities are persistent and buffered to the effects of natural pulses of short durations.},

Here, we applied a hydrologic model driven by a large suite of climate change scenarios to simulate both historical and future sediment yield and transport in two large, adjacent watersheds in the Great Lakes region. Using historical dredging expenditure data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, we then developed a pair of statistical models that link sediment discharge from each river to dredging costs at the watershed outlet. Although both watersheds show similar slight decreases in streamflow and sediment yield in the near-term, by Mid-Century, they diverge substantially. Dredging costs are projected to change in opposite directions for the two watersheds; we estimate that future dredging costs will decline in the St. Joseph River by 8-16\% by Mid-Century but increase by 1-6\% in the Maumee River. Our results show that the impacts of climate change on sediment yield and dredging may vary significantly by watershed even within a region and that agricultural practices will play a large role in determining future streamflow and sediment loads. We also show that there are large variations in responses across climate projections that cause significant uncertainty in sediment and dredging projections.},

Prairie dogs have declined dramatically across their former range, prompting reintroduction efforts to restore their populations and ecosystem functions, but the success of these reintroductions is rarely monitored rigorously. Here, we reintroduced 2,400 Gunnison's prairie dogs (C. gunnisoni) over a period of 6 years to the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, in central New Mexico, U.S.A., a semi-arid grassland ecosystem at the southern edge of their range. We evaluated the population dynamics of prairie dogs following their reintroduction, and their consequent effects on grassland vertebrates. We found postrelease survival of prairie dogs stabilized at levels typical for the species (ca. 50\%) after approximately 1 month, while average annual recruitment was ca. 0.35 juveniles per female, well below what was required for a self-sustaining, stable population. Extreme drought conditions during much of the study period may have contributed to low recruitment. However, recruitment increased steadily over time, indicating that the reintroduced colony may simply need more time to establish in this arid system. We also found well-known associates of prairie dog colonies, such as American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), were significantly more common on the colonies than off. After 7 years, we have yet to meet our goal of establishing a self-sustaining population of Gunnison's prairie dogs in this semi-arid grassland. But despite the uncertainty and challenges, our work shows that reestablishing keystone species can promote ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are biogeochemically active ecosystems where primary production and respiration interact with physico-chemical conditions to influence nutrient availability across spatio-temporal scales. The effect of episodic disturbances on water quality dynamics within wetlands is relatively unknown, especially in large oligotrophic wetlands such as the Everglades. We describe a range of episodic disturbance events and their impacts on the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water total N (TN) and total P (TP) concentrations in the Everglades as a means to understand their effect and legacies. Water quality monitoring along the two principal drainages-Taylor Slough (TS) and Shark River Slough (SRS)-has been ongoing since 2000, spanning myriad disturbances ranging from high-energy storms such as Hurricane Wilma in 2005 to a record cold event in 2010 and large fires. Local events include pulsed rainfall, low marsh stage, and stage recession and recovery (i.e., droughts and subsequent dry-to-wet transitions). The deposition of marine-derived sediment from Hurricane Wilma corresponded with a doubling of TP in SRS mangrove sites (from 0.39 to 0.84 mu mol/L) before recovering to pre-disturbance mean after 5-6 yr. A brief increase in TP within one week of the 2010 cold event was followed by delayed spikes in TN ({\textgreater}1000 mu mol/L) and TN:TP exceeding 5000 after one month. In 2008, a large fire in upper SRS prior to the wet season caused a lagged TP pulse at downstream locations SRS2, SRS3, and possibly SRS4. TP also varied negatively with depth/stage in marsh sites and positively with salinity in estuarine sites, reflecting physical concentration or dilution effects. In upper TS, TP varied according to extremes such as high rainfall and low stage relative to normal conditions. Although excess P in the Everglades is generally derived from anthropogenic upland or natural marine sources, episodic disturbance mobilizes internal sources of nutrients along an Everglades freshwatcr-to-estuary continuum, affecting water quality from days to years depending on disturbance type and intensity. The capacity for resilience is high in coastal wetland ecosystems that are exposed to high-energy tropical storms and other episodic events, even in the highly managed Florida Everglades.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive marine ecosystems and are currently threatened by natural disturbances such as predator outbreaks and tropical storms that can facilitate community shifts from coral to macroalgae. Such shifts have received considerable attention since macroalgae are known to inhibit coral recruitment, and thus hinder or prevent recovery to the coral-dominated state. It is critical to understand mechanisms that permit the establishment and persistence of macroalgae. Though many macroalgae are chemically and physically defended against herbivores as adults, these defenses may be lower during early life stages. One potential mechanism that could facilitate the establishment and persistence of macroalgae is an associational refuge whereby early life stages are protected from herbivory in close proximity of older, less palatable conspecifics. Using Turbinaria ornata as a model macroalga, I tested whether an associational refuge between different life stages could facilitate the establishment and long-term persistence of Turbinaria in the lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia. Results suggest that Turbinaria may only be limited by herbivory as recruits, which can lead to the establishment of Turbinaria if the alga survives the brief period when it is especially vulnerable to herbivores. I also tested whether vulnerable recruits experience a refuge from herbivory when they are associated with relatively unpalatable adults, and found that survival of recruits was higher when they were associated with adults than when alone. I also found that the value of a refuge can be spatially variable because the association with adults has a growth and survivorship cost to recruits where herbivory was low. These mechanisms can promote persistent macroalgal assemblages and limit the capacity of herbivores to control macroalgae and reverse a phase shift.},

	abstract = {Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) invasion and preemptive logging practices alter the habitat structure of New England forests and may indirectly affect associated small mammal communities. Microhabitat structure was measured and small mammals were censused in eight large experimental plots to quantify these effects. The Harvard Forest long-term ecological research experiment is a replicated two-block design that includes four similar to 0.81-ha canopy treatments: (1) hemlock control, (2) hardwood control, (3) girdled Treatment, in which hemlock trees were killed by girdling in 2005 and left standing to simulate HWA invasion, and (4) logged treatment, in which trees were removed to simulate preemptive logging management practices. Nine microhabitat characteristics were measured from plot photos revealing differences among ground and canopy microhabitat structure. Small mammals were censused during high (2012) and low (2013) abundant years. Populations of common species were estimated with mark-recapture analysis. Perotnyscus spp. were not affected by treatment in either year, but southern red-backed vole populations were greatest in the girdled treatments in 2012 and rarely captured in 2013. Between 6 and 9 mammal species were recorded in all treatments and species composition varied slightly. Estimated species richness was greater in girdled treatments than hemlock controls, but did not differ between girdled and logged treatments, which suggests preemptive logging is as detrimental to some small mammal species as HWA invasion. Overall, there is little evidence of a major shift in small mammal community structure in response to HWA invasion, with only minor changes in relative abundance both years.},

	abstract = {Climate change is increasing the intensity of severe tropical storms and cyclones (also referred to as hurricanes or typhoons), with major implications for tropical forest structure and function. These changes in disturbance regime are likely to play an important role in regulating ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient dynamics in tropical and subtropical forests. Canopy opening and debris deposition resulting from severe storms have complex and interacting effects on ecosystem biogeochemistry. Disentangling these complex effects will be critical to better understand the long-term implications of climate change on ecosystem C and nutrient dynamics. In this study, we used a well-replicated, long-term (10years) canopy and debris manipulation experiment in a wet tropical forest to determine the separate and combined effects of canopy opening and debris deposition on soil C and nutrients throughout the soil profile (1m). Debris deposition alone resulted in higher soil C and N concentrations, both at the surface (0-10cm) and at depth (50-80cm). Concentrations of NaOH-organic P also increased significantly in the debris deposition only treatment (20-90cm depth), as did NaOH-total P (20-50cm depth). Canopy opening, both with and without debris deposition, significantly increased NaOH-inorganic P concentrations from 70 to 90cm depth. Soil iron concentrations were a strong predictor of both C and P patterns throughout the soil profile. Our results demonstrate that both surface- and subsoils have the potential to significantly increase C and nutrient storage a decade after the sudden deposition of disturbance-related organic debris. Our results also show that these effects may be partially offset by rapid decomposition and decreases in litterfall associated with canopy opening. The significant effects of debris deposition on soil C and nutrient concentrations at depth ({\textgreater}50cm), suggest that deep soils are more dynamic than previously believed, and can serve as sinks of C and nutrients derived from disturbance-induced pulses of organic matter inputs.},

	abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry theory (EST) is a key framework for predicting how variation in N:P supply ratios influences biological processes, at molecular to ecosystem scales, by altering the availability of C, N, and P relative to organismal requirements. We tested EST predictions by fertilizing five forest streams at different dissolved molar N:P ratios (2, 8, 16, 32, 128) for two years and tracking responses of macroinvertebrate consumers to the resulting steep experimental gradient in basal resource stoichiometry (leaf litter \%N, \%P, and N:P). Nitrogen and P content of leaf litter, the dominant basal resource, increased in all five streams following enrichment, with steepest responses in litter \%P and N:P ratio. Additionally, increases in primary consumer biomass and production occurred in all five streams following N and P enrichment (averages across all streams: biomass by 1.2x, production by 1.6x). Patterns of both biomass and production were best predicted by leaf litter N:P and \%P and were unrelated to leaf litter \%N. Primary consumer production increased most in streams where decreases in leaf litter N:P were largest. Macroinvertebrate predator biomass and production were also strongly positively related to litter \%P, providing robust experimental evidence for the primacy of P limitation at multiple trophic levels in these ecosystems. However, production of predatory macroinvertebrates was not related directly to primary consumer production, suggesting the importance of additional controls for macroinvertebrates at upper trophic positions. Our results reveal potential drivers of animal production in detritus-based ecosystems, including the relative importance of resource quality vs. quantity. Our study also sheds light on the more general impacts of variation in N:P supply ratio on nutrient-poor ecosystems, providing strong empirical support for predictions that nutrient enrichment increases food web productivity whenever large elemental imbalances between basal resources and consumer demand are reduced.},

	abstract = {Understanding how each component of an ecosystem contributes to carbon fluxes across a range of abiotic conditions enables accurate forecasts for future emission scenarios. In drylands, biological soil crust (biocrust) contribution to ecosystem carbon fluxes may vary at a regional scale but is rarely quantified due to the difficulty of parameterizing process-based models or parsing biocrust (on the soil surface) from whole-soil flux measurements. We measured excised biocrust carbon fluxes across current and future predicted warmer summertime temperatures from dryland sites (grassland, shrubland, savanna, and woodland) and compared those to the ecosystem and soil fluxes from eddy flux towers. Overall, biocrust fluxes showed net carbon loss during the warm growing season temperatures, suggesting that cool-season photosynthesis is likely critical for maintaining positive biocrust carbon balance in these sites. Biocrust flux temperature responses differed by site: Grassland and shrubland biocrust gross photosynthesis was relatively invariant, while respiration increased with temperature; in the woodland and savanna, biocrust gross photosynthesis and respiration increased with temperature. Biocrust fluxes contributed {\textless}3\% to the observed ecosystem gross primary productivity at 26 degrees C and ecosystem respiration at 19 degrees C in grassland, shrubland, and woodland, but contributed {\textgreater}10\% of observed soil respiration in grassland and shrubland at 19 degrees C, reinforcing the need to separate biocrust activity from root and subsurface heterotroph activity to understand drivers of fluxes at different sites. Regional resolution of biocrust type and cover will improve predictions of biocrust contribution to global carbon flux with changing temperatures.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Productivity in drylands may depend on the sensitivity of interactions between plants and biocrusts. Given future climate variability, it is essential to understand how interactions may be context-dependent with precipitation regime. Furthermore, little is known about the additional interactions of these producers with the belowground biota (e.g., roots, fungi, microarthropods). We evaluated the effect of removal (such as could occur following disturbance) and net interaction of plants and biocrusts and additionally manipulated the abiotic and biotic context. METHODS: We established field mesocosms containing grass (Bouteloua gracilis) and surrounding biocrusts, then clipped the plant or heat-sterilized the biocrust to simulate the loss of dryland producers. To test for context-dependency on the precipitation pattern, we imposed a large, infrequent or small, frequent precipitation regime. A mesh barrier was used to impede belowground connections that may couple the dynamics of producers. Productivity was assessed by plant biomass and biocrust chlorophyll content. KEY RESULTS: Biocrusts increased chlorophyll content more when plants were removed than when they were present in the first year, but only in the small, frequent precipitation regime. In contrast, plant growth slightly declined with biocrust removal. Plant biomass and biocrust chlorophyll content were negatively correlated in the second year, suggesting net competition. Belowground connectivity weakly promoted overall biocrust relative productivity, but was generally weakly detrimental to plant relative productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Altered precipitation patterns can amplify positive effects of plant removal on biocrust producers. Furthermore, we discovered that belowground networks contributed to dryland productivity by promoting biocrust performance.},

	abstract = {Interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and different physical-chemical forms of iron (Fe) represent important biogeochemical processes in the organic carbon cycle. Due to the effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, the loading of terrestrial DOM into aquatic systems is increasing, and thus, enhancing the organic matter-based acidity in aquatic ecosystems. While complexation of Fe with DOM and the sorption of DOM on iron oxides and (oxy) hydroxides have been reported, less is known about how co-precipitation processes might affect by DOM composition. Here the co-precipitation of two DOM standards, namely the Suwannee River Standard Humic Acid Standard II (SRHA) and Nordic Aquatic Fulvic Acid Reference (NAFA), with Fe was investigated in a pH range of 4.0-8.0. The DOM remaining after co-precipitating with Fe was systematically characterized by various analytical methods to reveal the molecular fractionation of DOM. The co-precipitation of SRHA or NAFAwith Fe was enhanced by decreasing the pH, where at pH 4.0, about 70 similar to 80\% DOC of SRHA or NAFA was removed at Fe(III)/C ratios higher than 0.12. The decrease in SUVA(254) and the humification index (HIX) during the co-precipitation process suggests that DOM with high aromatic character was preferentially co-precipitated with Fe. DOM molecular weight influenced the selectivity to co-precipitation, with high molecular weight (HMW) DOM showing a stronger affinity. DOM co-precipitation with Fe was clearly dependent on DOM composition, showing an affinity order of terrestrial humic-like{\textgreater} ubiquitous humic-like{\textgreater} microbial humic-like components. The difference in the reactivity and the relative abundances of excitation emission matrix fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) components explained the difference in DOC removal efficiency between SRHA and NAFA. This study provides direct insights into the effects of DOM composition on its fractionation specifically through co-precipitation with Fe, and suggests that for aquatic systems rich in iron-based (oxy) hydroxides, and for environmental redox interfaces, co-precipitation of DOM with iron might affect optical properties of the aqueous phase, and represent an important sink for terrestrially-derived organic matter.},

	abstract = {We develop and evaluate a method to estimate O-3 deposition and stomatal O-3 uptake across networks of eddy covariance flux tower sites where O-3 concentrations and O-3 fluxes have not been measured. The method combines standard micrometeorological flux measurements, which constrain O-3 deposition velocity and stomatal conductance, with a gridded dataset of observed surface O-3 concentrations. Measurement errors are propagated through all calculations to quantify O-3 flux uncertainties. We evaluate the method at three sites with O(3 )flux measurements: Harvard Forest, Blodgett Forest, and Hyytiala Forest. The method reproduces 83 \% or more of the variability in daily stomatal uptake at these sites with modest mean bias (21 \% or less). At least 95 \% of daily average values agree with measurements within a factor of 2 and, according to the error analysis, the residual differences from measured O-3 fluxes are consistent with the uncertainty in the underlying measurements. The product, called synthetic O-3 flux or SynFlux, includes 43 FLUXNET sites in the United States and 60 sites in Europe, totaling 926 site years of data. This dataset, which is now public, dramatically expands the number and types of sites where O-3 fluxes can be used for ecosystem impact studies and evaluation of air quality and climate models. Across these sites, the mean stomatal conductance and O-3 deposition velocity is 0.03-1.0 cm s(-1). The stomatal O-3 flux during the growing season (typically April-September) is 0.5-11.0 nmol O-3 m(-2) s(-1) with a mean of 4.5 nmol O(3 )m(-2) s(-1) and the largest fluxes generally occur where stomatal conductance is high, rather than where O-3 concentrations are high. The conductance differences across sites can be explained by atmospheric humidity, soil moisture, vegetation type, irrigation, and land management. These stomatal fluxes suggest that ambient O-3 degrades biomass production and CO2 sequestration by 20 \%-24 \% at crop sites, 6 \%-29 \% at deciduous broadleaf forests, and 4 \%-20 \% at evergreen needleleaf forests in the United States and Europe.},

	abstract = {Despite its widespread use, the ecological effects of shoreline armoring are poorly synthesized and difficult to generalize across soft sediment environments and structure types. We developed a conceptual model that scales predicted ecological effects of shore-parallel armoring based on two axes: engineering purpose of structure (reduce/slow velocities or prevent/stop flow of waves and currents) and hydrodynamic energy (e.g., tides, currents, waves) of soft sediment environments. We predicted greater ecological impacts for structures intended to stop as opposed to slow water flow and with increasing hydrodynamic energy of the environment. We evaluated our predictions with a literature review of effects of shoreline armoring for six possible ecological responses (habitat distribution, species assemblages, trophic structure, nutrient cycling, productivity, and connectivity). The majority of studies were in low-energy environments (51 of 88), and a preponderance addressed changes in two ecological responses associated with armoring: habitat distribution and species assemblages. Across the 207 armoring effects studied, 71\% were significantly negative, 22\% were significantly positive, and 7\% reported no significant difference. Ecological responses varied with engineering purpose of structures, with a higher frequency of negative responses for structures designed to stop water flow within a given hydrodynamic energy level. Comparisons across the hydrodynamic energy axis were less clear-cut, but negative responses prevailed ({\textgreater} 78\%) in high-energy environments. These results suggest that generalizations of ecological responses to armoring across a range of environmental contexts are possible and that the proposed conceptual model is useful for generating predictions of the direction and relative ecological impacts of shoreline armoring in soft sediment ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Grasslands, which provide fundamental ecosystem services in many arid and semiarid regions of the world, are undergoing rapid increases in fire activity and are highly susceptible to postfire-accelerated soil erosion by wind. A quantitative assessment of physical processes that integrates fire-wind erosion feedbacks is therefore needed relative to vegetation change, soil biogeochemical cycling, air quality, and landscape evolution. We investigated the applicability of a novel tracer techniquethe use of multiple rare earth elements (REE)to quantify soil transport by wind and to identify sources and sinks of wind-blown sediments in both burned and unburned shrub-grass transition zone in the Chihuahuan Desert, NM, USA. Results indicate that the horizontal mass flux of wind-borne sediment increased approximately threefold following the fire. The REE tracer analysis of wind-borne sediments shows that the source of the horizontal mass flux in the unburned site was derived from bare microsites (88.5\%), while in the burned site it was primarily sourced from shrub (42.3\%) and bare (39.1\%) microsites. Vegetated microsites which were predominantly sinks of aeolian sediments in the unburned areas became sediment sources following the fire. The burned areas showed a spatial homogenization of sediment tracers, highlighting a potential negative feedback on landscape heterogeneity induced by shrub encroachment into grasslands. Though fires are known to increase aeolian sediment transport, accompanying changes in the sources and sinks of wind-borne sediments may influence biogeochemical cycling and land degradation dynamics. Furthermore, our experiment demonstrated that REEs can be used as reliable tracers for field-scale aeolian studies.},

	abstract = {Desert ecosystems are primarily limited by water availability. Within a climatic regime, topography, soil characteristics, and vegetation are expected to determine how the combined effects of precipitation, temperature, and evaporative demand of the atmosphere shape the spatial and temporal patterns of water within the soil profile and across a landscape. To forecast how desert landscapes may respond to future dimatic conditions, it is imperative to improve our understanding of these ecohydrologic processes. Here, we report on 27 yr of monthly soil volumetric water content (VWC) measurements and associated soils data from a site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of North America. The dataset includes VWC and soil properties measured to 3 m in depth across 15 locations that encompass a range of Chihuahuan Desert vegetation types. We use this unique dataset (1) to generate insights into general temporal and depth patterns in VWC, (2) to analyze how VWC corresponds to measures of climatic conditions, and (3) to qualitatively evaluate the relative importance of soils, topographic setting, and vegetation type in mediating temporal patterns in VWC. Analyses of this unique dataset emphasize the importance of soil and topographic setting in determining depth and temporal patterns in VWC across time. Results emphasize the episodic nature of deep wetting events in our study system-essentially limited to three large events over the 27-yr record driven primarily by wetter than normal winters. Comparison of soil water dynamics between mesquite shrub coppice dunes and interspace soils suggests the "island of fertility" concept does not extend to soil water. Median VWC was strongly coupled to climatic conditions over surprisingly long windows at most locations (6-18 months), suggesting that soil water at depth is decoupled from short climatic pulses. However, VWC dynamics and VWC-climate relationships varied among locations, depths, and seasons, with unexpected similarities in ecohydrologic dynamics observed among very different vegetation types (e.g., an eroded creosote shrubland and a playa grassland). These results further underscore the importance of ecohydrological investigations in these ecosystems, given forecasts for a warmer and more variable climate in deserts globally.},

	abstract = {For poikilothermic organisms in aquatic environment, temperature strongly affects metabolism and modulates the extent to which it is mass transfer limited. The effects of temperature on metabolism are translated into organism performance depending on the organism size, morphology, and the flow regime to which they are exposed. Environmental forcing of metabolism is particularly germane to tropical reef corals, because they increasingly are exposed to upward temperature perturbations to which they display variable responses that remain incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the effects of colony size and seawater turbulence on the response of the common Indo-Pacific branching coral, Pocillopora verrucosa, to different seawater temperatures. Using whole-colony calcification as a response variable, 12 tanks (each 150 l) were used in two trials lasting 14 days to contrast the effects of seawater turbulence (two levels) and temperature (25.5 vs 29.5 degrees C) on colonies varying in size from similar to 4 to 13-cm diameter. Turbulence in the tanks was measured as the root mean square (rms) turbulent flow speed (q(rms)), which quantified the variation in speed of complex and non-linear flow, regardless of direction. Treatments contrasted low (q(rms) = 0.63 cm s(-1)) and high (q(rms) = 2.07 cm s(-1)) turbulence that were ecologically relevant for shallow coral reefs. The effects of turbulent flow speed and temperature on calcification (mg day(-1)) differed among colony sizes: at 25.5 degrees C, calcification increased with tissue surface area at a slower rate under high, compared to low turbulent flow speeds; at low turbulent flow speeds, calcification increased with tissue surface area more slowly at 29.5 versus 25.5 degrees C. These results show that the response of branching corals to temperatures depends on colony size and turbulent flow speed. This outcome suggests that spatial heterogeneity in turbulent flow regimes across a coral reef may provide opportunities for branching corals to exploit colony size to modulate susceptibility to rising temperature.},

	abstract = {Across Mediterranean-type climate regions, seasonal drought desiccates plants, facilitating ignition and the spread of wildfires. Along the California coast, summertime fog has the potential to ameliorate drought conditions and thus reduce plant flammability during a critical time of elevated fire risk. This study investigated the uptake of dry season fog and how it affects live fuel moisture (LFM) in six dominant shrub species from chaparral and sage scrub plant associations. Fog water uptake was evaluated using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen at several field sites in Santa Barbara County, California. Clear evidence of fog water uptake was identified only in Baccharis pilularis, from the sage scrub association. To determine the effects of fog on LFM, meteorological variables and indices including fog deposition were combined into principal components and the scores regressed against the LFM loss rate during the summer drought. Fog deposition slowed rates of LFM loss for all three sage scrub species tested, but it did not affect the chaparral species. Fog is a more regular occurrence in the sage scrub association, and thus, it is likely that fog ameliorates drought for species that experience consistent fog during the summer months. In coastal California, summer fog can be essential to plant water relations and reduce LFM loss rates during the summer drought. Understanding these effects is important in the context of changing climate in southern California and fire-prone regions around the world.},

	abstract = {While the history of a fluvial hydrosystem can provide essential knowledge on present functioning, historical context remains rarely considered in river restoration. Here we show the relevance of an interdisciplinary study for improving restoration within the framework of a European LIFE C project on the French side of the Upper Rhine (Rohrschollen Island). Investigating the planimetric evolution combined with historical high-flow data enabled us to reconstruct pre-disturbance hydromorphological functioning and major changes that occurred on the reach. A deposition frequency assessment combining vertical evolution of the Rhine thalweg, chronology of deposits in the floodplain, and a hydrological model revealed that the period of incision in the main channel corresponded to high rates of narrowing and lateral channel filling. Analysis of filling processes using Passega diagrams and IRSL dating highlights that periods of engineering works were closely related to fine sediment deposition, which also presents concomitant heavy metal accumulation. In fact, current fluvial forms, processes and sediment chemistry around Rohrschollen Island directly reflect the disturbances that occurred during past correction works, and up to today. Our results underscore the advantage of combining functional restoration with detailed knowledge of the past trajectory to (i) understand the functioning of the hydrosystem prior to anthropogenic disturbances, (ii) characterize the human-driven morphodynamic adjustments during the last 2 centuries, (iii) characterize physico-chemical sediment properties to trace anthropogenic activities and evaluate the potential impact of the restoration on pollutant remobilization, (iv) deduce the post-restoration evolution tendency and (v) evaluate the efficiency and sustainability of the restoration effects. We anticipate our approach will expand the toolbox of decision-makers and help orientate functional restoration actions in the future.},

The factors that control this patterning are complex and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Soil microbes are critical to ecosystem function but exhibit highly complex distributions and community dynamics due in large part to the scale-dependent effects of environmental heterogeneity. To better understand the impact of environmental heterogeneity on the distribution of soil microbes, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from bacterial communities in the microbe-dominated polar desert ecosystem of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. Significant differences in key edaphic variables and alpha diversity were observed among the three lake basins of the Taylor Valley (Kruskal-Wallis; pH: chi(2) = 68.89, P {\textless} 0.001, conductivity: chi(2) = 35.03, P {\textless} 0.001, observed species: chi(2) = 7.98, P = 0.019 and inverse Simpson: chi(2) = 18.52, P {\textless} 0.001) and each basin supported distinctive microbial communities (ANOSIM R = 0.466, P = 0.001, random forest ratio of 14.1). However, relationships between community structure and edaphic characteristics were highly variable and contextual, ranging in magnitude and direction across regional, basin, and local scales. Correlations among edaphic factors (pH and soil conductivity) and the relative abundance of specific phyla were most pronounced along local environmental gradients in the Lake Fryxell basin where Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria declined while Deinococcus-Thermus and Gemmatimonadetes increased with soil conductivity (all P {\textless} 0.1). Species richness was most strongly related to the soil conductivity gradient present within this study system. We suggest that the relative importance of pH versus soil conductivity in structuring microbial communities is related to the length of edaphic gradients and the spatial scale of sampling. These results highlight the importance of conducting studies over large ranges of key environmental gradients and across multiple spatial scales to assess the influence of environmental heterogeneity on the composition and diversity of microbial communities.},

Recently, many citizen science programs have endeavored to help provide these much-needed data. Implementation of MPAs under the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative in Southern California was followed by a monitoring program to establish a comprehensive baseline of the ecological conditions of several marine ecosystems at the time of MPA implementation. This baseline monitoring consortium involved several citizen science monitoring programs alongside more traditional academic monitoring programs, creating an opportunity to evaluate the potential for citizen scientists to become more involved in future long-term monitoring efforts. We investigated different citizen science models, their program goals, and contributions to MPA baseline monitoring, including their respective monitoring protocols and data quality assurance measures, in the context of the goals of the MLPA baseline monitoring program. We focused on three very different case studies: (i) commercial fishermen and other volunteers collaborating with researchers to study the California spiny lobster, (ii) volunteer divers monitoring rocky reefs with the Reef Check California (RCCA) program and (iii) middle and high school students monitoring the inter-tidal life of rocky shore and sandy beach ecosystems with the National Marine Sanctuaries' Long-term Monitoring Program and Experiential Training for Students (LiMPETS) program. We elucidate capacities and potential of citizen science approaches for MPA baseline monitoring and for building capacity towards sustainable long-term monitoring of MPAs. Results from this study will be relevant and timely as the monitoring of California's MPAs transitions from baseline to long-term monitoring, and as citizen science continues to become more prevalent in California and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {For central Europe in addition to rising temperatures an increasing variability in precipitation is predicted. This will increase the probability of drought periods in the Alps, where water supply has been sufficient in most areas so far. For Alpine grasslands, community-specific imprints on drought responses are poorly analyzed so far due to the sufficient natural water supply. In a replicated mesocosm experiment we compared evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass productivity of two differently drought-adapted Alpine grassland communities during two artificial drought periods divided by extreme precipitation events using high-precision small lysimeters. The drought-adapted vegetation type showed a high potential to utilize even scarce water resources. This is combined with a low potential to translate atmospheric deficits into higher water conductance and a lower biomass production as those measured for the non-drought-adapted type. The non-drought-adapted type, in contrast, showed high water conductance potential and a strong increase in ET rates when environmental conditions became less constraining. With high rates even at dry conditions, this community appears not to be optimized to save water and might experience drought effects earlier and probably more strongly. As a result, the water use efficiency of the drought-adapted plant community is with 2.6 gDW kg(-1) of water much higher than that of the non-drought-adapted plant community (0.16 gDW kg(-1)). In summary, the vegetation's reaction to two covarying gradients of potential evapotranspiration and soil water content revealed a clear difference in vegetation development and between water-saving and water-spending strategies regarding evapotranspiration.},

In order to examine the specificity and extent of these associations, we established mixed cultures from three different freshwater environments and analyzed the cooccurrence of organisms using a metagenomic time series. Free-living microorganisms with streamlined genomes lacking multiple biosynthetic pathways showed no clear recurring pattern in their interaction partners. Free-living freshwater bacteria form promiscuous cooperative associations. This notion contrasts with the well-documented high specificities of interaction partners in host-associated bacteria. Considering all data together, we suggest that highly abundant free-living bacterial lineages are functionally versatile in their interactions despite their distinct streamlining tendencies at the single-cell level. This metabolic versatility facilitates interactions with a variable set of community members.},

Mapping metagenomic sequences to reference genomes derived from the same environment can reveal genetic heterogeneity within populations, and in some cases, be used to identify boundaries between genetically similar, but ecologically distinct, populations. Here we examine population-level heterogeneity within abundant and ubiquitous freshwater bacterial groups such as the acI Actinobacteria and LD12 Alphaproteobacteria (the freshwater sister clade to the marine SAR11) using 33 single-cell genomes and a 5-year metagenomic time series. The single-cell genomes grouped into 15 monophyletic clusters (termed "tribes") that share at least 97.9\% 16S rRNA identity. Distinct populations were identified within most tribes based on the patterns of metagenomic read recruitments to single-cell genomes representing these tribes. Genetically distinct populations within tribes of the acI Actinobacterial lineage living in the same lake had different seasonal abundance patterns, suggesting these populations were also ecologically distinct. In contrast, sympatric LD12 populations were less genetically differentiated. This suggests that within one lake, some freshwater lineages harbor genetically discrete (but still closely related) and ecologically distinct populations, while other lineages are composed of less differentiated populations with overlapping niches. Our results point at an interplay of evolutionary and ecological forces acting on these communities that can be observed in real time.},

Using a nested, spatially blocked sampling design on the coast of Georgia, USA, we compared the biota and environmental characteristics of 60 marshes adjacent to either a bulkhead, a residential backyard with no armoring, or an intact forest. We found that marshes adjacent to bulkheads were at lower tidal elevations and had features typical of lower elevation marsh habitats: high coverage of the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora, high density of crab burrows, and muddy sediments. Marshes adjacent to unarmored residential sites had higher soil water content and lower porewater salinities than the armored or forested sites, suggesting that there may be increased freshwater input to the marsh at these sites. Deposition of Spartina wrack on the marsh-upland ecotone was negatively related to elevation at armored sites and positively related at unarmored residential and forested sites. Armored and unarmored residential sites had reduced densities of the high marsh crab Armases cinereum, a species that moves readily across the ecotone at forested sites, using both upland and high marsh habitats. Distance from the upland to the nearest creek was longest at forested sites. The effects observed here were subtle, perhaps because of the small-scale, scattered nature of development. Continued installation of bulkheads in the southeast could lead to greater impacts such as those reported in more densely armored areas like the northeastern USA. Moreover, bulkheads provide a barrier to inland marsh migration in the face of sea level rise. Retaining some forest vegetation at the marsh-upland interface and discouraging armoring except in cases of demonstrated need could minimize these impacts.},

	abstract = {Background: Temperate urban landscapes support persistent and growing populations of Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors. Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions. Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50\%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled. Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations.},

However, recent studies and model simulations based on resource optimization theory indicate that productivity can be co-limited by N and P. We conducted a full factorial N x P fertilization experiment in 13 northern hardwood forest stands of three age classes in central New Hampshire, USA, to test the hypothesis that forest productivity is co-limited by N and P. We also asked whether the response of productivity to N and P addition differs among species and whether differential species responses contribute to community-level co-limitation. Plots in each stand were fertilized with 30kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), 10kg P center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), N + P, or neither nutrient (control) for four growing seasons. The productivity response to treatments was assessed using per-tree annual relative basal area increment (RBAI) as an index of growth. RBAI responded significantly to P (P = 0.02) but not to N (P = 0.73). However, evidence for P limitation was not uniform among stands. RBAI responded to P fertilization in mid-age (P = 0.02) and mature (P = 0.07) stands, each taken as a group, but was greatest in N-fertilized plots of two stands in these age classes, and there was no significant effect of P in the young stands. Both white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) responded significantly to P; no species responded significantly to N. We did not find evidence for N and P co-limitation of tree growth. The response to N + P did not differ from that to P alone, and there was no significant N x P interaction (P = 0.68). Our P limitation results support neither the N limitation prediction of ecosystem theory nor the N and P co-limitation prediction of resource optimization theory, but could be a consequence of long-term anthropogenic N deposition in these forests. Inconsistencies in response to P suggest that successional status and variation in site conditions influence patterns of nutrient limitation and recycling across the northern hardwood forest landscape.},

	abstract = {Global climate models predict increases in the frequency and severity of drought worldwide, directly affecting most ecosystem types. Consequently, drought legacy effects (drought-induced alterations in ecosystem function postdrought) are expected to become more common in ecosystems varying from deserts to grasslands to forests. Drought legacies in grasslands are usually negative and reduce ecosystem function, particularly after extended drought. Moreover, ecosystems that respond strongly to drought (high sensitivity) might be expected to exhibit the largest legacy effects the next year, but this relationship has not been established. We quantified legacy effects of a severe regional drought in 2012 on postdrought (2013) aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in six central US grasslands. We predicted that (1) the magnitude of drought legacy effects measured in 2013 would be positively related to the sensitivity of ANPP to the 2012 drought, and (2) drought legacy effects would be negative (reducing 2013 ANPP relative to that expected given normal precipitation amounts). The magnitude of legacy effects measured in 2013 was strongly related (r (2) = 0.88) to the sensitivity of ANPP to the 2012 drought across these six grasslands. However, contrary to expectations, positive legacy effects (greater than expected ANPP) were more commonly observed than negative legacy effects. Thus, while the sensitivity of ANPP to drought may be a useful predictor of the magnitude of legacy effects, short-term (1-year) severe droughts may cause legacy effects that are more variable than those observed after multiyear droughts.},

We observed strong effects of arsenate exposure on growth, biomass allocation (leaf, stem and root mass fractions), pigments and phenolic compounds. CO2 availability strongly affected the content in phenolic compounds and a fewother response variables, yet overall effects were less pronounced than expected. Strong interactive effects of CO2 availability and arsenic concentration were only observed for carotenoids, the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio and phenolic compounds in leaves. Only the carbon content declined with increasing arsenic concentration, otherwise leaf elemental content and stoichiometry were not affected by arsenic or CO2 availability, suggesting that plants strived to maintain leaf functions. The observed effects on biomass allocation and plant quality, specifically dry matter content and phenolic compound content of M. spicatum not only show direct changes in plant performance but suggest also indirect effects on ecological interactions such as competition or herbivory.},

	abstract = {Desert ecosystems are one of the fastest urbanizing areas on the planet. This rapid shift has the potential to alter the abundances and species richness of herbivore land plant communities. Herbivores, for example, are expected to be more abundant within urban desert remnant parks located within cities due to anthropogenic activities that concentrate food resources and reduce native predator populations. Despite this assumption, previous research conducted around Phoenix, AZ, USA has shown that top-down herbivory led to equally reduced plant biomass in both urban and outlying locations. It is unclear if this insignificant difference in herbivory at urban and outlying sites is due to unaltered desert herbivore populations or altered activity levels that counteract abundance differences. Small rodent herbivore/granivore populations were surveyed at four sites inside and four sites outside of the core of Phoenix during fall 2014 and spring 2015 in order to determine whether abundances and richness differ significantly between urban and rural sites. In order to survey species composition and abundance at these sites, 100 Sherman traps and eight larger wire traps that are designed to attract and capture small vertebrates such as mice, rats, and squirrels were set at each site for two consecutive trap nights. Results suggest that the commonly assumed effect of urbanization on herbivore abundances does not apply to small rodent populations in a desert city, as overall small rodent abundances were statistically similar regardless of location. Though a significant difference was not found for species richness, a significant difference between small rodent genus richness at these sites was observed, with altered community composition. The compositional differences likely reflect the altered vegetative community and may impact ecological interactions at these sites.},

	abstract = {Seismic reflection images of thermohaline circulation from the Bellingshausen Sea, adjacent to the West Antarctica Peninsula, were acquired during February 2015. This survey shows that bright reflectivity occurs throughout the upper 300 m. By calibrating these seismic images with coeval hydrographic measurements, intrusion of warm water features onto the continental shelf at Marguerite and Belgica Troughs is identified and characterized. These features have distinctive lens-shaped patterns of reflectivity with lengths of 0.75-11.00 km and thicknesses of 100-150 m, suggesting that they are small mesoscale to submesoscale eddies. Abundant eddies are observed along a transect that crosses Belgica Trough. Near Alexander Island Drift, a large, of order (O)102 km(3), bowl-like feature, that may represent an anticyclonic Taylor column, is imaged on a pair of orthogonal images. A modified iterative procedure is used to convert seismic imagery into maps of temperature that enable the number and size of eddies being transported onto the shelf to be quantified. Finally, analysis of prestack shot records suggests that these eddies are advecting southward at speeds of O(0.1) ms(-1), consistent with limited legacy hydrographic measurements. Concentration of observed eddies south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front implies they represent both a dominant, and a long-lived, mechanism of warm-water transport, especially across Belgica Trough. Our observations suggest that previous estimates of eddy frequency may have been underestimated by up to 1 order of magnitude, which has significant implications for calculations of ice mass loss on the shelf of the West Antarctic Peninsula.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is declining in many local communities while also becoming increasingly homogenized across space. Experiments show that local plant species loss reduces ecosystem functioning and services, but the role of spatial homogenization of community composition and the potential interaction between diversity at different scales in maintaining ecosystem functioning remains unclear, especially when many functions are considered (ecosystem multifunctionality). We present an analysis of eight ecosystem functions measured in 65 grasslands worldwide. We find that more diverse grasslands-those with both species-rich local communities (alpha-diversity) and large compositional differences among localities (alpha-diversity)-had higher levels of multifunctionality. Moreover, alpha-and alpha-diversity synergistically affected multifunctionality, with higher levels of diversity at one scale amplifying the contribution to ecological functions at the other scale. The identity of species influencing ecosystem functioning differed among functions and across local communities, explaining why more diverse grasslands maintained greater functionality when more functions and localities were considered. These results were robust to variation in environmental drivers. Our findings reveal that plant diversity, at both local and landscape scales, contributes to the maintenance of multiple ecosystem services provided by grasslands. Preserving ecosystem functioning therefore requires conservation of biodiversity both within and among ecological communities.},

Nutrient concentrations (P and N) did not significantly correlate with the abundances of these compounds. In contrast, n-alkadienes and n-alkatrienes were present in wider diversity and higher abundance in the floc from slough (deeper water and longer hydroperiod) than ridge (shallower water and shorter hydroperiod) locations. n-Alkadienes, n-alkatrienes, and lycopadiene, showed lower delta C-13 values from -40.0 to -35.5 parts per thousand, suggesting that the source organisms B. braunii at least partially utilize recycled CO2 (C-13 depleted) produced from OM respiration rather than atmospheric CO2 (C-13 enriched) as the major carbon sources.},

Here we report the results from an experimental manipulation in a tidal freshwater Zizaniopsis miliacea marsh on the Altamaha River, GA where diluted seawater was added to replicate marsh plots on either a press (constant) or pulse (2 months per year) basis. We measured changes in porewater chemistry (SO42-, Cl-, organic C, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus), ecosystem CO2 and CH4 exchange, and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. We found that press (chronic) seawater additions increased porewater chloride and sulfate almost immediately, and ammonium and phosphate after 2-4 months. Chronic increases in salinity also decreased net ecosystem exchange, resulting in reduced CO2 and CH4 emissions from press plots. Our pulse treatment, designed to mimic natural salinity incursion in the Altamaha River (September and October), temporarily increased porewater ammonium concentrations but had few lasting effects on porewater chemistry or ecosystem carbon balance. Our findings suggest that long-term, chronic saltwater intrusion will lead to reduced C fixation and the potential for increased nutrient (N, P) export while acute pulses of saltwater will have temporary effects.},

We hypothesized that keystone taxa, which influence community assembly through strong biotic interactions, are important for regulating microbial community composition. While highly connected microbes have been identified, evidence that these taxa act as keystones is lacking, because keystone status requires influence on whole-community dynamics. We address this gap, showing that small subsets of highly connected keystone taxa (generally 1\%-5\% of richness) can be optimal predictors of whole-community compositional change. In three long-term data sets, greater connectivity due to the presence of keystone taxa corresponded to lower compositional turnover. We further hypothesized that the influence of keystone taxa would be diminished when environmental disturbance was a strong driver of compositional change. We used two case studies of reference and disturbed communities to investigate how biotic and abiotic forces interact to shape community composition. Most of the same taxa were present in both the reference and disturbed communities, but keystone taxa had much greater explanatory power in the reference communities. Our results suggest that greater biotic connectivity arising from the presence of keystone taxa is stabilizing to community composition, and that keystone taxa can be good indicators of pending community shifts.},

The associated immigration and extinction events are likely constrained by the spatial distribution of species. Still, studies on environmental change typically quantify biotic responses at single spatial (time series within a single plot) or temporal (spatial beta diversity at single time points) scales, ignoring their potential interdependence. Here, we use data from a global network of grassland experiments to determine how turnover responses to two major forms of environmental change - fertilisation and herbivore loss - are affected by species pool size and spatial compositional heterogeneity. Fertilisation led to higher rates of local extinction, whereas turnover in herbivore exclusion plots was driven by species replacement. Overall, sites with more spatially heterogeneous composition showed significantly higher rates of annual turnover, independent of species pool size and treatment. Taking into account spatial biodiversity aspects will therefore improve our understanding of consequences of global and anthropogenic change on community dynamics.},

We explored this issue on the fore reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, following a crown-of-thorns seastar outbreak and cyclone that dramatically reduced cover of coral. During the five-years following the disturbances, the rate of reestablishment of coral cover differed systematically around the triangular-shaped island; coral cover returned most rapidly at sites where the least amount of live coral remained after the disturbances. Although sites differed greatly in the rate of return of coral, all showed at least some evidence of reassembly to their pre-disturbance community structure in terms of relative abundance of coral taxa and other benthic space holders. The primary driver of spatial variation in recovery was recruitment of sexually-produced corals; subsequent growth and survivorship were less important in shaping the spatial pattern. Our findings suggest that, although the coral community has been resilient, some areas are unlikely to attain the coral cover and taxonomic structure they had prior to the most recent disturbances before the advent of another landscape-scale perturbation.},

Green stormwater infrastructure and gray stormwater infrastructure are two types of water management strategies communities can use to address water pollution. In this study, we used long-term control plans from 25 U.S. cities to synthesize: the types of gray and green infrastructure being used by communities to address combined sewer overflows; the types of goals set; biophysical characteristics of each city; and factors associated with the governance of stormwater management. These city characteristics were then used to identify common characteristics of "green leader" cities-those that dedicated {\textgreater} 20\% of the control plan budget In green infrastructure. Five "green leader" cities were identified: Milwaukee, WI, Philadelphia, PA, Syracuse, NY, New York City, NY, and Buffalo, NY. These five cities had explicit green infrastructure goals targeting the volume of stormwater or percentage of impervious cover managed by green infrastructure. Results suggested that the management scale and complexity of the management system are less important factors than the ability to harness a "policy window" to integrate green infrastructure into control plans. Two case studies-Philadelphia, PA, and Milwaukee, WI-indicated that green leader cities have a long history of building momentum for green infrastructure through a series of phases from experimentation, demonstration, and finally in the case of Philadelphia a full transition in the approach used to manage CSOs.},

	abstract = {Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is a major land cover change taking place in many regions of the world, including arctic, alpine and desert ecosystems. This change in plant dominance is also affecting coastal ecosystems, including barrier islands, which are known for being vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In the last century, the woody plant species Morella cerifera L. (Myricaceae), has encroached into grass covered swales in many of the barrier islands of Virginia along the Atlantic seaboard. The abrupt shift to shrub cover in these islands could result from positive feedbacks with the physical environment, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We use a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the role of climate warming and the ability of M.cerifera to mitigate its microclimate thereby leading to the emergence of alternative stable states in barrier island vegetation. Nighttime air temperatures were significantly higher in myrtle shrublands than grasslands, particularly in the winter season. The difference in the mean of the 5\% and 10\% lowest minimum temperatures between shrubland and grassland calculated from two independent datasets ranged from 1.3 to 2.4 degrees C. The model results clearly show that a small increase in near-surface temperature can induce a non-linear shift in ecosystem state from a stable state with no shrubs to an alternative stable state dominated by M.cerifera. This modeling framework improves our understanding and prediction of barrier island vegetation stability and resilience under climate change, and highlights the existence of important nonlinearities and hystereses that limit the reversibility of this ongoing shift in vegetation dominance.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes and land-use changes can have major impacts on the carbon cycle of ecosystems. Their combined effects have rarely been tested. We studied whether and how the abandonment of traditionally managed mountain grassland changes the resilience of carbon dynamics to drought. In an in situ common garden experiment located in a subalpine meadow in the Austrian Central Alps, we exposed intact ecosystem monoliths from a managed and an abandoned mountain grassland to an experimental early-summer drought and measured the responses of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, phytomass and its components, and of leaf area index during the drought and the subsequent recovery period. Across all these parameters, the managed grassland was more strongly affected by drought and recovered faster than the abandoned grassland. A bivariate representation of resilience confirmed an inverse relationship of resistance and recovery; thus, low resistance was related to high recovery from drought and vice versa. In consequence, the overall perturbation of the carbon cycle caused by drought was larger in the managed than the abandoned grassland. The faster recovery of carbon dynamics from drought in the managed grassland was associated with a significantly higher uptake of nitrogen from soil. Furthermore, in both grasslands leaf nitrogen concentrations were enhanced after drought and likely reflected drought-induced increases in nitrogen availability. Our study shows that ongoing and future land-use changes have the potential to profoundly alter the impacts of climate extremes on grassland carbon dynamics.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time that are most relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and places (beta-diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a long-term (18-year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude, amounting to 19\% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environments.},

	abstract = {In the 1970s, Forest Service and academic researchers clearcut the forest in Watershed 7 in the Coweeta Basin to observe how far the perturbation would move the ecosystem and how quickly the ecosystem would return to its predisturbance state. Our long-term observations demonstrated that this view of resistance and resilience was too simplistic. Forest disturbance triggered a chain of ecological dynamics that are still evolving after 40 years. Short-term pulses in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (3 years) and streamflows (4 years) were followed by several years in which the system appeared to be returning to predisturbance conditions. Then however, changes in forest composition triggered a regime change in DIN dynamics from biological to hydrological control as well as persistent high stream DIN levels mediated by climatic conditions. These forest composition changes also led to later reductions in streamflow. These long-term observations of streamflows, stream DIN concentrations, stream DIN exports, and stand composition have substantially advanced our understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics; and they demonstrate the value of long-term observational data in revealing ecosystem complexities and surprises, generating new hypotheses, and motivating mechanistic research. Shorter observational records from this experiment would have produced incomplete or erroneous inference.

The 2-D subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3-D Richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. A Normally Integrated Model (NIM) is first compared with the integrated model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry, heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment, and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface. This exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low-dimensional model (by a factor of 6). NIM is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem, namely, Rohrschollen Island of the Upper Rhine River, with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy. The calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the Rhine to an old and clogged channel. The low-dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state-of-the-art integrated models employing the solution of the 3-D Richards equation. It is, however, suited to investigate fine-scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments, with reasonable computational costs and a physically-based approach to model flow processes.},

	abstract = {Cold content is a measure of a snowpack's energy deficit and is a linear function of snowpack mass and temperature. Positive energy fluxes into a snowpack must first satisfy the remaining energy deficit before snowmelt runoff begins, making cold content a key component of the snowpack energy budget. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds cold content development and its relationship to snowmelt, likely because of a lack of direct observations. This work clarifies the controls exerted by air temperature, precipitation, and negative energy fluxes on cold content development and quantifies the relationship between cold content and snowmelt timing and rate at daily to seasonal timescales. The analysis presented herein leverages a unique long-term snow pit record along with validated output from the SNOWPACK model forced with 23 water years (1991-2013) of quality controlled, infilled hourly meteorological data from an alpine and subalpine site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The results indicated that precipitation exerted the primary control on cold content development at our two sites with snowfall responsible for 84.4 and 73.0\% of simulated daily gains in the alpine and subalpine, respectively. A negative surface energy balance - primarily driven by sublimation and longwave radiation emission from the snowpack - during days without snowfall provided a secondary pathway for cold content development, and was responsible for the remaining 15.6 and 27.0\% of cold content additions. Non-zero cold content values were associated with reduced snowmelt rates and delayed snowmelt onset at daily to sub-seasonal timescales, while peak cold content magnitude had no significant relationship to seasonal snowmelt timing. These results suggest that the information provided by cold content observations and/or simulations is most relevant to snowmelt processes at shorter timescales, and may help water resource managers to better predict melt onset and rate.},

	abstract = {1. Despite high levels of disturbance and habitat modification, urban ecosystems still host substantial levels of biodiversity. The processes that maintain existing levels of diversity, however, remain understudied. Identifying the links between urban ecological processes and patterns has, therefore, become a fundamental research goal to support urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2. We conducted a study to determine how the diversity and composition of urban plant communities is affected by spatially and temporally variable land use legacies. We constructed a chronosequence of vacant lot properties covering a range of 3-22 years since demolition, in an urban neighbourhood in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). Surveys of herbaceous plant species abundance were conducted during the summers of 2012 and 2013 in sections of each vacant lot where the building previously stood (the "building footprint") and sections of the lot that was previously a backyard or garden (the "remnant garden"). 3. We found divergent patterns in plant community composition between areas of vacant lots with varying land use histories. This includes significant shifts in the functional composition of biotically vectored seed dispersal strategies, as well as an increase in seed mass and terminal velocity trait values of plant communities in building footprints over time. In addition, we found that plant communities in different sections of the same vacant lot tended to become more functionally dissimilar in seed dispersal strategies over time. In contrast, we found no significant changes in taxonomic diversity over time for any of our measures. 4. Policy implications. Our study suggests that regional-scale patterns of seed dispersal interact with diverse land use legacies to structure the plant communities of urban vacant lots. Although it has been suggested that highly altered local environmental conditions and competition from introduced species limit native plant diversity in urban environments, we find seed dispersal to be a more significant driver of urban plant community assembly patterns. Implementing management strategies that focus on habitat connectivity and enhancing species pools via seeding may present an effective strategy for promoting more successful establishment of diverse plant communities in urban environments.},

	abstract = {Parasitic infections are increasingly recognized as influential forces in the migratory behaviors of hosts ranging from butterflies to whales. In aquatic zooplankton, diel vertical migrations (DVMs) are among the most recurrent behaviors with implications for predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and energy flow, yet how parasitism affects such migrations remains an open question. Here, we tested the effects of sporangia cluster disease (SCD) on DVM of the large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria, which is often considered a key component of lake food webs. By collecting depth-specific zooplankton samples across diel cycles, between years, and among lakes, we show that infection is associated with strong inhibition of host DVM; while all Daphnia tended to occur deeper during the day, uninfected Daphnia and especially gravid individuals migrated to shallower waters at night. In contrast, infected hosts-which could comprise 40\% of the population-were more likely to remain deep regardless of time of day. Among infected hosts, the intensity of SCD (sporangia count per host) predicted the degree of DVM inhibition. These observations-coupled with lab-based assays showing that infected hosts exhibited fewer swimming movements and persisted at lower depths than uninfected conspecifics-suggest that parasite-induced inhibition of DVM is a "sickness behavior" resulting from increasing morbidity and energy depletion as the infection intensifies toward host death. Considering the importance of large-bodied Daphnia as regulators of water clarity and prey for fishes, parasite-induced alterations of host migratory behavior have broad potential to affect the redistribution of energy and nutrients within lake ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Disentangling trophic interactions among species is important for elucidating mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning and services. Carabid beetles are an important guild of predators that may regulate pest populations in arable landscapes, but their generalist feeding behavior hinders predictions about their actual contribution to pest control. In order to assess carabids' potential for pest control, we simultaneously analyzed the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of a community of 45 co-occurring species in wheat and oilseed rape fields. With the expectation to identify distinct trophic groups based on the mean and the variance of carabid isotopic signatures, we observed a high degree of overlap in trophic positions between species. However, we also observed that species could be successfully categorized into two groups according to whether or not their carbon signatures varied independently from variations in the crop baseline. We interpret these results as differential primary resource uptake or by differential mobility aptitude in foraging. Accordingly, we propose that the isotopic signal can inform us on the presence/absence of links between generalist predators and cultivated plants through the trophic networks they belong to, and consequently on their potential role as pest natural enemies. We therefore suggest the complementarity of stable isotope analysis for obtaining a time-integrated assessment of carabid trophic behavior that may be combined with more direct molecular diet analysis allowing the simultaneous quantification of specific trophic links within agricultural landscapes.},

However, how changes in abiotic conditions can affect the active proportion of the microbial community that is responsible for the delivery of key ecosystem services is poorly understood. Salt marshes, in particular salt marsh ponds, are highly dynamic habitats with abiotic conditions in the pond water that fluctuate on daily cycles. To determine how diurnally driven changes in abiotic conditions affect active microbial communities, we sampled a single salt marsh pond every 4 h over 2 diel cycles, sampling 2 dynamically different habitats: the pond sediment and overlying water. We assessed abiotic conditions and the total and active microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA. Sediments displayed no discernable pattern and low variation in abiotic conditions, leading to stable active microbial communities. However, the cyclical, rapidly changing abiotic conditions in the overlying water resulted in large changes in the active microbial community and in the percent of inactive taxa. Our data suggest that changes in environmental condition over short time periods alter the structure of active microbial communities. Further, our data show that the most abundant taxa in the active communities in the overlying water were rare ({\textless} 1\% total abundance), suggesting that under environmental change, rare taxa can disproportionally contribute to the activity of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have been widely used for calibration and evaluation of carbon flux estimates from terrestrial ecosystem models as well as for remote sensing-based estimates across various spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is vital to fully understand the land surface characteristics within the area contributing to these flux measurements (i.e. source area) when upscaling plot-scale tower measurements to regional-scale ecosystem estimates, especially in heterogeneous landscapes, such as mixed forests. We estimated the source area of a flux tower at a mixed forest (Harvard Forest in US) using a footprint model, and analyzed the spatial representativeness of the source area for the vegetation characteristics (density variation and magnitude) within the surrounding 1. and 1.5-km grid cells during two decades (1993-2011). Semi-variogram and window size analyses using 19 years of Landsat-retrieved enhanced vegetation index (EVI) confirmed that spatial heterogeneity within the 1-km grid cell has been gradually increasing for leaf-on periods. The overall prevailing source areas lay toward the southwest, yet there were considerable variations in the extents and the directions of the source areas. The source areas generally cover a large enough area to adequately represent the vegetation density magnitude and variation during both daytime and nighttime. We show that the variation in the daytime NEE during peak growing season should be more attributed to variations in the deciduous forest contribution within the source areas rather than the vegetation density. This study highlights the importance of taking account of the land cover variation within the source areas into gap-filling and upscaling procedures.},

	abstract = {In deciduous forests, spring leaf phenology controls the onset of numerous ecosystem functions. While most studies have focused on a single annual spring event, such as budburst, ecosystem functions like photosynthesis and transpiration increase gradually after budburst, as leaves grow to their mature size. Here, we examine the "velocity of green-up," or duration between budburst and leaf maturity, in deciduous forest ecosystems of eastern North America. We use a diverse data set that includes 301 site-years of phenocam data across a range of sites, as well as 22 years of direct ground observations of individual trees and 3 years of finescale high-frequency aerial photography, both from Harvard Forest. We find a significant association between later start of spring and faster green-up: - 0.47 +/- 0.04 (slope +/- 1 SE) days change in length of green-up for every day later start of spring within phenocam sites, - 0.31 +/- 0.06 days/day for trees under direct observation, and - 1.61 +/- 0.08 days/day spatially across fine-scale landscape units. To explore the climatic drivers of spring leaf development, we fit degree-day models to the observational data from Harvard Forest. We find that the default phenology parameters of the ecosystem model PnET make biased predictions of leaf initiation (39 days early) and maturity (13 days late) for red oak, while the optimized model has biases of 1 day or less. Springtime productivity predictions using optimized parameters are closer to results driven by observational data (within 1\%) than those of the default parameterization (17\% difference). Our study advances empirical understanding of the link between early and late spring phenophases and demonstrates that accurately modeling these transitions is important for simulating seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity.},

Here we construct a comprehensive Arctic food web based on functional groups of microbes (e.g., bacteria and fungi), protozoa, and invertebrates (community hereafter referred to as the invertebrate food web) residing in the soil, on the soil surface and within the plant canopy from an area of moist acidic tundra in northern Alaska. We used an energetic food web modeling framework to estimate C flow through the food web and group-specific rates of C and N cycling. We found that 99.6\% of C processed by the invertebrate food web is derived from detrital resources (aka 'brown' energy channel), while 0.06\% comes from the consumption of live plants (aka 'green' energy channel). This pattern is primarily driven by fungi, fungivorous invertebrates, and their predators within the soil and surface-dwelling communities (aka the fungal energy channel). Similarly, {\textgreater} 99\% of direct invertebrate contributions to C and N cycling originate from soil- and surface-dwelling microbes and their immediate consumers. Our findings demonstrate that invertebrates from within the fungal energy channel are major drivers of C and N cycling and that changes to their structure and composition are likely to impact nutrient dynamics within tundra ecosystems.},

Our modifications to ecosystem development theories (a) illustrate how press-pulse regimes can cause ecosystems to continue to develop or oscillate around a stable state (pulsed stability) or cause them to decline if the press-pulse regime changes faster than species and communities can adapt, (b) use examples from long-term ecological research of how attributes interact to affect development, and (c) suggest how revised and new theoretical frameworks can integrate long-term ecological research and observatory networks.},

We tracked changes in whole-stream ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP), particulate organic matter (POM) standing stocks, fungal biomass, and POM-specific respiration rates before and during 2 yr of experimental N and P enrichment in five forest streams. Nutrient additions (similar to 96 mu g N L-1 to similar to 472 mu g N L-1 and similar to 10 mu g P L-1 to similar to 85 mu g P L-1) targeted dissolved N : P molar ratios of 2, 8, 16, 32, and 128. Whole-stream ER was positively related to standing stock of wood, a seasonably stable POM compartment that varied by up to 2x among streams. Nutrient enrichment generally increased ER but had no effect on low-level GPP. Prior to nutrient enrichment, ER was higher at lower N : P, but during enrichment ER increased with increasing N : P. Respiration rates on leaf litter and wood increased with enrichment but decreased with increasing P, and the quantity of leaf litter generally declined with increasing N. Respiration rates on fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) were higher with increasing N : P, and FBOM standing stocks decreased with increasing N. Fungal biomass did not change with nutrient enrichment. Compared to pre-enrichment conditions, nutrients increased seasonal variation in leaf litter standing stocks and whole-stream respiration rates. Our results demonstrate how nutrient-stimulated loss of C from detritus-based ecosystems occurs through the maintenance of enhanced respiration rates on detrital resources that are particularly sensitive to N inputs.},

	abstract = {Ecological research networks functioning across climatic and edaphic gradients are critical for improving predictive understanding of biogeochemical cycles at local through global scales. One international network, the Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) Project, was established to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs influence accumulations or losses of organic matter in forest soils. DIRT employs chronic additions and exclusions of aboveground litter inputs and exclusion of root ingrowth to permanent plots at eight forested and two shrub/grass sites to investigate how soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics are influenced by plant detrital inputs across ecosystem and soil types. Across the DIRT network described here, SOM pools responded only slightly, or not at all, to chronic doubling of aboveground litter inputs. Explanations for the slow or even negative response of SOM to litter additions include increased decomposition of new inputs and priming of old SOM. Evidence of priming includes increased soil respiration in litter addition plots, decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) output from increased microbial activity, and biochemical markers in soil indicating enhanced SOM degradation. SOM pools decreased in response to chronic exclusion of aboveground litter, which had a greater effect on soil C than did excluding roots, providing evidence that root-derived C is not more critical than aboveground litter C to soil C sequestration. Partitioning of belowground contributions to total soil respiration were predictable based on site-level soil C and N as estimates of site fertility; contributions to soil respiration from root respiration were negatively related to soil fertility and inversely, contributions from decomposing aboveground litter in soil were positively related to site fertility. The commonality of approaches and manipulations across the DIRT network has provided greater insights into soil C cycling than could have been revealed at a single site. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Previous results show that overwash provides an important sediment source to back-barrier marshes, sustaining a narrow marsh state under conditions in which marsh drowning would otherwise occur. We expand the coupled barrier island-marsh evolution model GEOMBEST+ to explore the effects of wind waves on back-barrier marshes. We find that the addition of marsh edge erosion leads to wider, more resilient marshes and that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge is a more efficient sediment source than vertical erosion of the marsh surface as it drowns. Where marshes and bays are vertically keeping up with sea level, and the net rate of sediment imported to (or exported from) the basin is known, the rate of marsh edge erosion or progradation can be predicted knowing only the present basin geometry, sea level rise rate, and the net rate of sediment input (without considering the erosion or progradation mechanisms). If the rate of sediment input/export is known, this relationship applies whether sediment exchange with the open ocean is negligible (as in basins dominated by riverine sediment input) or is significant (including the loss of sediment remobilized by waves in the bay). Analysis of these results reveals that geometry and stratigraphy can exert a first-order control on back-barrier marsh evolution and on the marsh-barrier island system as a whole and provides new insights into the resilience of back-barrier marshes and on the interconnectedness of the barrier-marsh system. Plain Language Summary Sand washed across barrier islands during storms (called overwash) provides sediment for salt marshes behind those islands, and can allow a marsh which otherwise would drown to grow vertically fast enough to keep up with sea level. We use a barrier island-marsh evolution model (GEOMBEST+) to see what effect marsh edge erosion by waves has on overwash-supported marshes. Consistent with previous research, we find that wave erosion can make marshes more resilient by freeing sediment that can be used elsewhere on the marsh surface. We add that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge provides more sediment per volume eroded than vertical erosion of the marsh surface. This is because the bottom layers of the marsh contain more sediment (that can stay on marsh surfaces), while the surface layers include plant material (that drifts away or decomposes). We also find that when the marsh and bay are keeping up with sea level, expanding or eroding the marsh is the only way to change the volume of the bay, so how fast the marsh is expanding or eroding can be predicted using geometry, knowing only the size of the basin, sea-level-rise rate, and the net rate of sediment import or export.},

This study identifies areas with a high chance for severe snow gliding for an area covering {\textgreater} 20,000 km(2) in the Central and Eastern Alps. The Spatial Snow-Glide Model (SSGM) was used to map potential snow gliding areas (i.e. snow gliding distances). The results revealed 56\% of the investigated area to be potential snow gliding areas. Nearly 2000 km(2) (17\%) were prone to snow gliding distances of {\textgreater} 112 cm per winter period, indicating a high vulnerability for both glide cracks and glide-snow avalanches. Taking the inter-annual variability of winter precipitation into account, which turned out to be highest in the usually drier southern part, another 5690 km(2) were found to have a high risk for snow gliding damages. For planning purposes of on-site mitigation measures the Guidelines to Identify Snow-Glide Areas (GISGA) were validated to corroborate the sequential application of SSGM and GISGA for comprehensive assessment of snow gliding at landscape scale. We conclude that the application of SSGM and GISGA provides an appropriate evaluation framework for regional stakeholders to implement adequate steps to prevent critical snow gliding.},

	abstract = {The age and ability of salt marshes to accumulate and sequester carbon is often assessed using the carbon isotopic signatures (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) of sedimentary organic matter. However, transfers of allochthonous refractory carbon (C-RF) from the watershed to marshes would not represent new C sequestration. To better understand how refractory carbon (C-RF) inputs affect assessments of marsh age and C sequestration, Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of both total organic carbon (TOC), C-RF, and non-C-RF organic matter fractions were measured in salt marshes from four contrasting systems on the North Atlantic coast. To our knowledge, no salt marsh sediment study has considered refractory or allochthonous carbon in carbon budget calculations or the impact on chronologies. Stable and radiogenic isotope data suggest that while TOC was dominated by autochthonous plant inputs, C-RF was dominated by locally recycled or allochthonous C, the delivery of which was controlled by the size and slope of each watershed. Steep-gradient rivers analyzed delivered Delta C-14-depleted C-RF to their estuarine marshes, while the site located in the low-gradient river was associated with larger C-RF content. Finally, the marsh isolated from riverine input contained the least fraction of TOC as C-RF. Laterally transported C-RF caused only a small offset in Delta C-14 in relation to TOC in low-gradient systems (average Delta C-14 offset was -44.4 and -24.2 parts per thousand at each location). However, the presence of allochthonous Delta C-14-depleted C-RF in sediments of steep-gradient rivers led to large overestimates of the time of organic matter deposition (i.e. apparent age was older than the 'true' time of deposition) (Delta C-14 offset ranged from -170.6 to -528.9 parts per thousand). Further, reliance on TOC or loss on ignition analyses to calculate C sequestration by marshes might produce overestimates of at least as much as 10 to 20\% since neither account for the lateral transport of allochthonous carbon.

In addition to details on inputs, outputs, and the computing environment collected by most provenance tools, RDataTracker also records a detailed execution trace and intermediate data values. It does this using R's powerful introspection functions and by parsing R statements prior to sending them to the interpreter so it knows what provenance to collect. The provenance is stored in a specialized graph structure called a Data Derivation Graph, which makes it possible to determine exactly how an output value is computed or how an input value is used. In this paper, we provide details about the provenance RDataTracker collects and the mechanisms used to collect it. We also speculate about how this rich source of information could be used by other tools to help an R programmer gain a deeper understanding of the software used and to support reproducibility.},

We validate this method by comparing simultaneous albedo estimates by UAV and a fixed tower at the same site. We found that UAV provided stable albedo measurements across multiple flights, with results that were well within the range of tower-estimated albedo at similar forested sites. Our results indicate that in-situ albedo measurements (tower and UAV) capture more site-to-site variation in albedo than satellite measurements. Overall, we show that UAVs produce reliable, consistent albedo measurements that can capture crucial surface heterogeneity, clearly distinguishing between different land uses. Future application of this approach can provide detailed measurements of albedo and potentially other vegetation indices to enhance global research and modeling efforts.},

The objective of the study was to assess if {\textgreater} 30 years of N deposition have resulted in a decline in exchangeable base cations (C-B) coupled with an increase of exchangeable aluminum (Al). We used soil and stream data sampled between 1982 and 2015 at Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range to evaluate the change in an alpine catena. The C-B in the surface horizons of the summit position decreased significantly from 45 cmol(c) kg(-1) in 1982 to 2.3 cmol(c) kg(-1) in 2015, while the exchangeable Al increased from 0.09 cmol(c) kg(-1) to 0.7 cmol(c) kg(-1) in the summit and from 8.9 cmol(c) kg(-1) to 10.5 cmol(c) kg(-1) in the toeslope. Spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture along the catena exhibited the lowest values during the winter months because the temperature was below freezing. The soil moisture increased in early spring as soil-temperature rose. A Seasonal Kendall test (SK) showed that the soil moisture decreased along the catena by -0.007 m(3) m(-3) yr(-1) (P {\textless} 0.001). The soil moisture trend coincided with a soil temperature increase from the summit to toeslope of 0.68 degrees yr(-1). Segmental SK analysis of acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) measured in the outlet of the lake below the catena showed a decrease of -2.15 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for the first monitoring period from 1982 to 1995, and an increase by 0.51 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) during the second monitoring period from 1995 to 2014. These trend analyses attest to the limited influence of the alpine soil system on the overall aquatic chemistry. Hence, a clear distinction should be made between the alpine soils and the terrestrial system (e.g., rock glacier, taluses, and screes). Most of the soils have little impact on the aquatic system, whereas other terrestrial features are more important in this regard.},

In addition to lawn-only measurements, we collected and analyzed plant species richness for entire yards cultivated (intentionally planted) and spontaneous (self-regenerating) for front and backyards in just two cities: LA and SLC. Lawn plant species and soils were not different between front and backyards in our multi-city comparisons. However, entire-yard plant analyses in LA and SLC revealed that frontyards had significantly fewer species than backyards for both cultivated and spontaneous species.

	abstract = {The Mississippi River and other large rivers have the potential to regulate nitrogen export from terrestrial landscapes, and thus mitigate eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems. In large rivers, human-constructed impoundments and connected backwaters may facilitate nitrogen removal; however, the capacity of these features is poorly quantified and incompletely incorporated into model frameworks. Using a high-resolution and spatially intensive sampling technique, we assessed the contribution of individual navigation pools, as well as impounded open waters and backwater wetlands within them, to overall nitrate retention by mapping the entire length (1370 km) of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) main channel. Based on this single spatial survey of water chemistry, the river appeared to act primarily as a passive nitrate transporter, retaining only 12.5\% of the incoming load, most of which occurred in the upper 150 km of the river, which includes the largest and only naturally impounded reach of the river. Although reservoirs typically are nitrogen sinks, our data indicate that UMR dams do not impede river flows to the extent necessary to promote substantial changes in water residence times and subsequent nitrogen removal. Backwaters routinely had lower nitrate concentrations than the main channel, but their limited hydrologic connectivity to the through-flowing river channel constrained their influence on downstream export. As a whole, the UMR did not remove a substantial proportion of its nitrate load despite optimal N removal conditions, numerous impoundments, and the presence of extensive backwater habitats. These results suggest that efforts to reduce delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico should emphasize mitigation strategies that target upland nutrient sources rather than relying on removal within the Mississippi River.},

	abstract = {Alkenones are C35-C42 polyunsaturated ketone lipids that are commonly employed to reconstruct changes in sea surface temperature. However, their use in coastal seas and saline lakes can be hindered by species-mixing effects. We recently hypothesized that freshwater lakes are immune to species-mixing effects because they appear to exclusively host Group I haptophyte algae, which produce a distinct distribution of alkenones with a relatively consistent response of alkenone unsaturation to temperature. To evaluate this hypothesis and explore the geographic extent of Group I haptophytes, we analyzed alkenones in sediment and suspended particulate matter samples from lakes distributed throughout the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (n = 30). Our results indicate that Group I-type alkenone distributions are widespread in freshwater lakes from a range of different climates (mean annual air temperature range: -17.3-10.9 degrees C; mean annual precipitation range: 125-1657 mm yr(-1); latitude range: 40-81 degrees N), and are commonly found in neutral to basic lakes (pH {\textgreater} 7.0), including volcanic lakes and lakes with mafic bedrock. We show that these freshwater lakes do not feature alkenone distributions characteristic of Group II lacustrine haptophytes, providing support for the hypothesis that freshwater lakes are immune to species-mixing effects. In lakes that underwent temporal shifts in salinity, we observed mixed Group I/II alkenone distributions and the alkenone contributions from each group could be quantified with the RIK37 index. Additionally, we observed significant correlations of alkenone unsaturation (U-37(K)) with seasonal and mean annual air temperature with this expanded freshwater lakes dataset, with the strongest correlation occurring during the spring transitional season (U-37(K) = 0.029 * T - 0.49; r(2) = 0.60; p {\textless} 0.0001). We present new sediment trap data from two lakes in northern Alaska (Toolik Lake, 68.632 degrees N, 149.602 degrees W; lake E5, 68.643 degrees N, 149.458 degrees W) that demonstrate the highest sedimentary fluxes of alkenones in the spring transitional season, concurrent with the period of lake ice melt and isothermal mixing. Together, these data provide a framework for evaluating lacustrine alkenone distributions and utilizing alkenone unsaturation as a lake temperature proxy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, climate-induced shrub expansion may counteract these losses if their higher-quality litter (lower C:N) is efficiently incorporated into microbial products and stabilized within the soil. Alternatively, increased C inputs could stimulate microbial decomposition of old soil organic matter (SOM) through priming mechanisms. We investigated whether inputs of low molecular weight carbon (LMW-C) induced SOM priming or retention in soils underlying Eriophorum vaginatum, an ubiquitous tussock-forming sedge, and Betula nana, a dominant shrub that is expanding its range and coverage across the Arctic. We did not find evidence of priming, defined as an increase in the decomposition of native SOM stocks, from soils underlying either vegetation type. However, microbial respiration of new LMW-C inputs was twice as high in soils underlying E. vaginatum than B. nana, while belowground retention of new LMW-C inputs was 150\% higher in soils underlying B. nana. Our results highlight the extraordinary capacity of shrub colonized soils to retain new C inputs belowground, which may mitigate soil C loss as the Arctic climate warms.},

Identifying such key species remains challenging, especially in the tropics where many species co-occur and can potentially support the same or different processes. Here, we developed a new community-wide scan CWS) approach, analogous to the genome-wide scan, to identify fish species that significantly contribute, beyond the socio-environmental and species richness effects, to the biomass and coral cover on Indo-Pacific reefs. We found that only a limited set of species (51 out of approx. 400, = approx. 13\%), belonging to various functional groups and evolutionary lineages, are strongly and positively associated with fish biomass and live coral cover. Many of these species have not previously been identified as functionally important, and thus may be involved in unknown, yet important, biological mechanisms that help sustain healthy and productive coral reefs. CWS has the potential to reveal species that are key to ecosystem functioning and services and to guide management strategies as well as new experiments to decipher underlying causal ecological processes.},

PBDE-47 and -99 were the dominant congeners determined in all samples, constituting {\textgreater} 60\% of total PBDEs.

Results for krill and phytoplankton also suggested increasing PBDE concentrations over time. Trends of PBDEs in fur seal milk of individual seals sampled 1 or more years apart showed no clear temporal trends. Overall, there was no indication of PBDEs decreasing in Antarctic biota yet, whereas numerous studies have reported decreasing trends in the northern hemisphere. Similar PBDE concentrations in perinatal versus nonperinatal milk implied the importance of local PBDE sources for bioaccumulation. These results indicate the need for continued assessment of contaminant trends, such as PBDEs, and their replacements, in Antarctica.},

Here, we hypothesized that a prey less vulnerable to Chaoborus larvae, such as Physocypria schubarti ostracods, could affect the predatory performance of Chaoborus on a more vulnerable prey, such as Ceriodaphnia silvestrii neonates. We predicted that fewer neonates would be ingested by Chaoborus larvae in the presence of ostracods at high densities due to the decreased attack efficiency caused by the confusion effect. This hypothesis was tested by combining predation assays and direct visual observations of live organisms. There was a significant decrease in the consumption of neonates when they were offered together with ostracods at high densities; however, this was not related to the ingestion of ostracods as an alternative prey or to decreased attack efficiency on neonates caused by the confusion. The energy wasted due to the numerous attacks on the ostracods ("fake prey") possibly led the chaoborids to exhaustion, reducing their predatory performance on neonates. In ecological terms, high densities of ostracods in the water column may theoretically minimize the strong impact of Chaoborus sp. larvae on more vulnerable prey.},

Multiple regression was used to determine how much variance could be explained in five hydrologic variables describing the flashiness of peak flow (three original metrics), total seasonal flashiness (Richards Baker flashiness index), and the ratio of total winter stormflow to total discharge (the stormflow index). Models were constrained to three uncorrelated (vertical bar 0.65 vertical bar) variables to prevent overfitting to the dataset. Average-, dry-, and wet-years were subset using the z-scores for winter precipitation derived from the 4 km monthly PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) dataset, for the period of 1986-2006. Relief, slope, and landscape connectivity explain the majority of explained variance in all five of the hydrologic variables during all time periods. During dry-, average-, and wet-years, atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific/North American Pattern) explain more variance than total seasonal precipitation (PRISM), which is not true in the majority of the all-years models. Land cover explains only a small portion of the variance in regional stormflow and only when sub-divided based on soil parent material.

This increase will overshadow the effect of decreased precipitation amount that could cause up to a 50\% decrease in recharge beneath playas. These changes could have a significant impact on groundwater and carbon storage. These results are important given that groundwater resources in Southwestern USA continue to decline due to human consumption outpacing natural recharge of aquifers. Here, we report on groundwater recharge rates ranging from less than 1 mm to greater than 25 mm per year beneath desert playas. Playas located in larger and steeper catchments with finer-textured soils had the highest rates of recharge. Vegetation cover had no effect on recharge beneath playas. We modeled catchment runoff generation and found that the amount of runon a playa receives annually strongly correlated to the rate of groundwater recharge beneath that playa. Runon occurred during precipitation events larger than 20 mm and increased linearly with events above that threshold.},

Recent research showed how upland-catchment biophysical characteristics control the amount of organic carbon and nutrients that accumulates in playas from upland grasslands and shrublands. Here we further explored the role of allochthonous and autochthonous processes in fixing carbon and accruing soil nutrients in playas across a desert basin. We assessed whether playas contribute soil nutrient, organic-carbon stocks, and primary productivity rates in amounts disproportionately higher or lower than upland grasslands and shrublands. We found that playas had higher soil carbon and nutrient storage but no difference in mean annual primary production. Playas, on average, had similar primary productivity than upland systems, because they exhibited lower productivity during extremely wet years that offset the larger productivity during average or below average precipitation years. These results suggest that playas contain higher carbon and soil nutrient stocks because of runoff-mediated allochthonous inputs, rather than autochthonous sources, since long-term average productivity was similar to upland ecosystems. We also used the precipitation-aboveground net primary production (ANPP) relationships to accurately measure run-on in playas using differences between playa and upland grassland ANPP. The dependence of playa ANPP on surface-water inputs from upland catchments makes them susceptible to future changes in extreme precipitation events.},

Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether the food resource of planktonic protozoa comes mainly from small primary producers or heterotrophic bacteria in tropical shallows lakes, assuming the hypothesis that, in general, picocyanobacteria would be the main food resource for protists. We also expected that the autotrophic fraction would be mainly related to protists at the surface of the environments, while the heterotrophic fraction would be more important at the lower strata of the water column. We performed size-fractionation experiments to evaluate the effects of predation of protists on heterotrophic bacteria and picocyanobacteria. We also sampled planktonic organisms at the subsurface and bottom of 20 lakes in a Neotropical floodplain. We found an herbivory preference of heterotrophic flagellates, while ciliates seem to exert a stronger impact on heterotrophic bacteria. We also found no relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and protists in the field data, whereas positive relationships between picocyanobacteria and protists were observed in environments where there was sunlight. Thus, both heterotrophic bacteria and picocyanobacteria were important components in the food webs of tropical shallow lakes. Moreover, the trophic cascade caused by zooplankton predation suggests that protists are efficient in transferring the energy from the base of microbial food webs to higher trophic levels.},

Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.},

	abstract = {In mathematical grassland models, plant communities may be represented by a various number of state variables, describing biomass compartments of some dominant species or plant functional types. The size of the initial species pool could have consequences on the outcome of the simulated ecosystem dynamics in terms of grassland productivity, diversity, and stability. This choice could also influence the model sensitivity to forcing parameters. To address these issues, we developed a dynamic grassland model, DynaGraM, designed to simulate seasonal changes in both aboveground biomass production and species composition of managed permanent grasslands under various soil, climate and management conditions. We compared simulation results from alternative instances of DynaGraM that only differ by the identity and number of state variables describing the green biomass, here plant species. We assessed the sensitivity of each instance of the model to key forcing parameters for climate, soil fertility, and defoliation disturbances, using univariate and multivariate regression trees and dynamic trees. Results of 10-year simulations under various climate, fertility and defoliation conditions showed that the final total biomass was tending to increase with the size of the species pool, while species evenness and the proportion of surviving species was tending to decrease. We found a positive correlation between the species survival ratio and the defoliation intensity, and this correlation increased with the initial species richness. The sensitivity to forcing parameters of community structure and species evenness differed markedly among alternative models, showing a progressive shift from high importance of soil fertility (fertilisation level, mineralization rate) to high importance of defoliation (mowing frequency, grazing intensity) as the size of the species pool increased. By contrast, the key drivers of total biomass production were independent of species richness and only linked to resource supply (nitrogen and water). These results highlight the need to take into account the role of species diversity to explain the behaviour of grassland models.},

	abstract = {Both submerged and emergent vegetation plays a fundamental role in coastal bays. Vegetation stabilizes the substrate, increasing resilience to storms. Vegetation also traps sediments favoring accretion and therefore counteracting sea level rise. Previous modeling studies on flow-vegetation-sediment interactions have focused on one specific vegetated community, but we lack a general understanding of the synergistic effects of multiple vegetation species. We focus our study on the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, USA, where we apply numerical modeling (Delft3D-SWAN) to investigate the independent and synergistic effects of salt marsh vegetation and seagrass. Our numerical results show that salt marshes and seagrass beds reduce the volume of water entering and exiting the shallow coastal bays up to 15\% during each tidal cycle. Vegetation also reduces bed shear stress and hence increases sediment deposition in the bay and marshes up to 10\% compared to the no-vegetated case. Our study shows the double benefits of seagrass as an ally of salt marsh in promoting bays resilience. On the one hand, seagrass helps the salt marsh to survive during storms by reducing wave energy; on the other hand, seagrass generates more friction in subtidal parts of the bay where salt marsh cannot survive.},

	abstract = {Groundwater flow regimes in the seasonally thawed soils in areas of continuous permafrost are relatively unknown despite their potential role in delivering water, carbon, and nutrients to streams. Using numerical groundwater flow models informed by observations from a headwater catchment in arctic Alaska, United States, we identify several mechanisms that result in substantial surface-subsurface water exchanges across the land surface during downslope transport and create a primary control on dissolved organic carbon loading to streams and rivers. The models indicate that surface water flowing downslope has a substantial groundwater component due to rapid surface-subsurface exchanges across a range of hydrologic states, from unsaturated to flooded. Field-based measurements corroborate the high groundwater contributions, and river dissolved organic carbon concentrations are similar to that of groundwater across large discharge ranges. The persistence of these groundwater contributions in arctic watersheds will influence carbon export to rivers as thaw depth increases in a warmer climate. Plain Language Summary This paper shows that groundwater processes have a dominant role in controlling carbon export from the land to streams in permafrost terrain. We use hydrologic models to show that microtopography on the land surface drives the rapid exchange of overland flow with shallow groundwater. In other words, the water (porpoises) from just above to just below the land surface and back again as it moves downslope. Combined with the rapid leaching of organic carbon from soils, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for two decades of measurements showing high concentrations of carbon in soils and streams during high flow conditions for both spring snowmelt and summer storms. During drier time periods, groundwater contributions from the thin thawed layer make up the flow in streams and keep dissolved organic carbon concentrations high. The persistence of these groundwater contributions in arctic watersheds will influence carbon export to rivers as thaw depth increases in a warmer climate.},

	abstract = {With strong horizontal gradients in physical properties, oceanic frontal regions can lead to disproportionately high biological productivity. We examined cross-frontal changes in mesopelagic fish assemblages at three separate frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) as part of the CCE Long Term Ecological Research program: the A-Front sampled in October 2008, the C-Front in June/July 2011, and the E-Front in July/August 2012. We analyzed the differential effects of front-associated regions on density and species composition of adult migratory and non-migratory fishes and larvae, and the larval to adult ratio (as a possible index of a population growth potential) for migratory and non-migratory species. The fronts did not have a strong effect on densities of any subset of the mesopelagic fish assemblage. The species composition of the vertical migratory fishes (and their larvae) was typically altered across fronts, with different assemblages present on either side of each front. The migratory assemblages at the fronts themselves were indistinguishable from those at the more productive side of the frontal system. In contrast, the assemblage composition of the non-migratory fishes was indistinguishable between regions across all three of the fronts. The differences between the Northern and Southern assemblages at the A-Front were primarily based on biogeographic provinces, while the assemblages at the E-Front were largely distinguishable by their oceanic or coastal-upwelling zone associations. These results generally confirm those of previous studies on frontal systems in the California Current Ecosystem and elsewhere. The ratio of larvae to adults, a potential index of population growth potential, was altered across two of the fronts for migratory species, elevated on the colder side of the A-Front and the warmer side of the E-Front. This finding suggests that fronts may be regions of enhanced reproduction. The larvae to adult ratio was indistinguishable for non-migratory species at all three frontal systems. The non-migratory component of the community was little influenced by the presence of a front, apparently because the regions of strongest horizontal spatial gradients were too shallow to be experienced directly. We speculate that there was no change in larval community composition and population growth index at the most dynamic frontal system (C-Front) compared to the other fronts surveyed because the frontal feature was short-lived relative to the time scale for population growth of the fish. However, the difference in results of the C-Front may also be due to a change in methodology used in this study. If mesoscale features such as fronts increase in frequency off the California coast in the future as predicted, they have the potential to alter population growth potential and restructure mesopelagic fish assemblages, which are dominated by migratory species.},

Here we report the effects of the severe 2015 Caribbean drought on soil moisture, oxygen, phosphorus (P), and greenhouse gas emissions in a humid tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Drought significantly decreases inorganic P concentrations, an element commonly limiting to net primary productivity in tropical forests, and significantly increases organic P. High-frequency greenhouse gas measurements show varied impacts across topography. Soil carbon dioxide emissions increase by 60\% on slopes and 163\% in valleys. Methane (CH4) consumption increases significantly during drought, but high CH4 fluxes post-drought offset this sink after 7 weeks. The rapid response and slow recovery to drought suggest tropical forest biogeochemistry is more sensitive to climate change than previously believed, with potentially large direct and indirect consequences for regional and global carbon cycles.},

	abstract = {1. Nocturnal transpiration can impact water balance from the local community to earth-atmosphere fluxes. However, the dynamics and drivers of nocturnal transpiration among coexisting plant functional groups in herbaceous ecosystems are unknown. 2. Here, we addressed the following questions: (1) How do nocturnal (E-night) and diurnal (E-day) transpiration vary among coexisting grasses, forbs, and shrubs in a tallgrass prairie? (2) What environmental variables drive E-night and do these differ from the drivers of E-day? (3) Is E-night associated with daytime physiological processes? 3. We measured diurnal and nocturnal leaf gas exchange on perennial grass, forb and woody species in a North American tallgrass prairie. Measurements were made periodically across two growing seasons (May-August 2014-2015) on three C-4 grasses (Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans and Panicum virgatum), two C-3 forbs (Vernonia baldwinii and Solidago canadensis), one C-3 sub-shrub (Amorpha canescens) and two C-3 shrubs (Cornus drummondii and Rhus glabra). 4. By extending our study to multiple functional groups, we were able to make several key observations: (1) E-night was variable among co-occurring plant functional groups, with the highest rates occurring in C-4 grasses, (2) E-night and E-day exhibited different responses to vapour pressure deficit and other environmental drivers, and (3) rates of E-night were strongly related to predawn leaf water potential for grasses and woody species, and were likely modulated by small-scale changes in soil moisture availability. 5. Our results provide novel insight into an often-overlooked portion of ecosystem water balance. Considering the high rates of E-night observed in C-4 grasses, as well as the widespread global occurrence of C-4 grasses, nocturnal water loss might constitute a greater proportion of global evapotranspiration than previously estimated. Additionally, future predictions of nocturnal water loss may be complicated by stomatal behaviour that differs between the day and at night. Finally, these data suggest a water-use strategy by C-4 grasses wherein the high rates of E-night occurring during wet periods may confer a competitive advantage to maximize resource consumption during periods of greater availability.},

We examine the potential drivers of solar variability and systematically eliminate all but stratospheric sulfur dioxide. We argue that increases in stratospheric sulfur dioxide increase stratospheric aerosol optical depth and decrease solar intensity. Because of the polar location of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (77-78 degrees S) and relatively long solar ray path through the stratosphere, terrestrial solar intensity is sensitive to small differences in stratospheric transmissivity. Important sources of sulfur dioxide include natural (wildfires and volcanic eruptions) and anthropogenic emission.},

	abstract = {Increasing air temperature is expected to extend growing season length in temperate, broadleaf forests, leading to potential increases in evapotranspiration and net carbon uptake. However, other key processes affecting water and carbon cycles are also highly temperature-dependent. Warmer temperatures may result in higher ecosystem carbon loss through respiration and higher potential evapotranspiration through increased atmospheric demand for water. Thus, the net effects of a warming planet are uncertain and highly dependent on local climate and vegetation. We analyzed five years of data from the Coweeta eddy covariance tower in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, USA, a highly productive region that has historically been under-represented in flux observation networks. We examined how leaf phenology and climate affect water and carbon cycling in a mature forest in one of the wettest biomes in North America. Warm temperatures in early 2012 caused leaf-out to occur two weeks earlier than in cooler years and led to higher seasonal carbon uptake. However, these warmer temperatures also drove higher winter ecosystem respiration, offsetting much of the springtime carbon gain. Interannual variability in net carbon uptake was high (147 to 364 g CM-2 y(-1)), but unrelated to growing season length. Instead, years with warmer growing seasons had 10\% higher respiration and sequestered similar to 40\% less carbon than cooler years. In contrast, annual evapotranspiration was relatively consistent among years (coefficient of variation = 4\%) despite large differences in precipitation (17\%, range = 800 mm). Transpiration by the evergreen understory likely helped to compensate for phenologically-driven differences in canopy transpiration. The increasing frequency of high summer temperatures is expected to have a greater effect on respiration than growing season length, reducing forest carbon storage.},

Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.},

Johannessen and Macdonald (2016) suggest that projects seeking offset-credits under the Verified Carbon Standard methodology VM0033: Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration will overestimate long-term (100 yr) sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage because issues affecting carbon burial rates bias storage estimates. These issues warrant serious consideration by the seagrass research community; however, VM0033 does not refer to seagrass SOC 'burial rates' or 'storage.' Projects seeking credits under VM0033 must document greenhouse gas emission reductions over time, relative to a baseline scenario, in order to receive credits. Projects must also monitor changes in carbon pools, including SOC, to confirm that observed benefits are maintained over time. However, VM0033 allows projects to conservatively underestimate project benefits by citing default values for specific accounting parameters, including CO2 emissions reductions. We therefore acknowledge that carbon crediting methodologies such as VM0033 are sensitive to the quality of the seagrass literature, particularly when permitted default factors are based in part on seagrass burial rates. Literature-derived values should be evaluated based on the concerns raised by Johannessen and Macdonald (2016), but these issues should not lead to credit over-allocation in practice, provided VM0033 is rigorously followed. These issues may, however, affect the feasibility of particular seagrass offset projects.},

In this study, we evaluated the effect of particle size and heterogeneity on rates of biofilm metabolism and nutrient uptake in colonized and native sediments normalized using two different scaling approaches. Coarse, pebble- to cobble-sized sediments were sorted into four homogeneous particle size treatments plus one heterogeneous treatment. Each treatment was deployed, in replicate, within one riffle and one run habitat feature in three different high-latitude stream reaches with contrasting hydrological and physicochemical characteristics. A treatment of native, homogeneous sediment was also evaluated at each deployment location. After incubating for approximately five weeks, metabolism and nutrient uptake of biofilms in all treatments (n=69) were measured in recirculating microcosm chambers. For each treatment, functional rates were normalized by projected surface area and sediment surface area scaling approaches, which account for the surface area in plan view (looking top-down) and the total surface area of all sediment particles, respectively. This comparison was designed to determine whether treatment effects were independent of increased surface area associated with smaller particle sizes or heterogeneous sediments. Community respiration and uptake of ammonium-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus by biofilms decreased significantly as the particle size of homogeneous treatments increased when normalized by projected surface area, but significantly increased with increasing particle size when normalized by sediment surface area. Sediment particle size had a limited influence on production rates evaluated across treatments. Heterogeneous and homogeneous treatments with similar median particle sizes did not differ significantly from one another for most biogeochemical functions measured. Our findings indicate that rates of biogeochemical function in heterogeneous habitats were directly related to the total sediment surface area available for biofilm colonization. The significant interactions between sediment surface area and rates of respiration and nutrient uptake suggest that information about the size and distribution of sediment particles could substantially improve our ability to predict and scale measurements of important biogeochemical functions in streams.},

We present the O-2-C (OC) method for calculating gas-exchange rates via simultaneous measurement of O-2 and dissolved inorganic C (DIC). Gas-exchange rates are calculated by solving the combined stream transport equation for O-2 and DIC. The output is a time-series of aeration rates at the same sampling frequency as the input O-2 and C data. Field tests in a 4th-order montane stream in Oregon, USA, indicate that the method is suitable for stream reaches with high downstream gas-concentration gradients and saturation deficits. The mean modeled aeration rate adjusted to 17 degrees C (3.25/h) agreed well with the value of 3.22/h from direct gas injection. Net ecosystem production calculated with the modeled aeration rate (-1.69 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was consistent with the result obtained with direct gas injection (-1.60 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). An assumption of the model is a constant respiration quotient, but results indicated that the respiration quotient may be time variable. Sensitivity analysis indicated that application of the OC method is limited to reaches with a suitable change in combined O-2 and CO2 concentration {\textgreater}= similar to 4 mu mol/L and combined O-2 and CO2 saturation deficits approximate to 4 mu mol/L, characteristic of smaller gaining streams. Preliminary application of the OC method indicates it could be useful to practitioners interested in continuous measurement of gas-exchange rates.},

	abstract = {Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4\% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soybean-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9\% compared to monocultures. In addition, disease suppressive potential was significantly diminished in the (non-crop) fallow treatment compared to the most diverse crop rotation treatments. The composition of the microbial community could be more important than diversity to disease suppressive function in our study. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.},

We found that abundance and species richness both appear higher at a site that experienced a moderate degree of burn damage than unburned control and severely burned sites. These findings suggest that the impacts of fires on bird communities may be minimal within 7 years post fire.

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are generally subjected to multiple perturbations due to simultaneous or successive combinations of various natural and anthropogenic environmental pressures. To better assess and predict the resulting ecological consequences, increasing attention should be given to the accumulation of stresses on freshwater ecosystems and its effects on the vulnerability of aquatic organisms, including microbial communities, which play crucial functional roles. Here we used a microcosm study to assess the influence of an experimental warming on the vulnerability of phototrophic and heterotrophic periphytic communities to acute and chronic copper (Cu) toxicity. Natural periphytic communities were submitted for 4 weeks to three different temperatures (18, 23, and 28 degrees C) in microcosms contaminated (at about 15 mu g L-1) or not with Cu. The vulnerability of both phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities to subsequent acute Cu stress was then assessed by measuring their levels of sensitivity to Cu from bioassays targeting phototrophic (photosynthetic activity) and heterotrophic (beta-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase extracellular enzymatic activities) microbial functions. We postulated that both the increase in temperature and the chronic Cu exposure would modify microbial community structure, thus leading to changes in the capacity of phototrophic and heterotrophic communities to tolerate subsequent acute exposure to Cu. Our results demonstrated that the influence of temperature on the vulnerability of phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities to Cu toxicity can vary greatly according to function studied. These findings emphasize the importance of considering different functional compartments and different functional descriptors to better assess the vulnerability of periphyton to multiple stresses and predict the risks induced by multiple stressors for ecosystem balance and functioning.},

Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance. We evaluated {\textgreater} 1300 tree saplings belonging to {\textgreater} 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth. A total of 44\% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates. Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.},

We characterized plant species richness and density, soil bacterial, fungal and eukaryotic species richness and phylogenetic diversity (using 16S, ITS, and 18S gene sequencing), and ecosystem function (levels of soil C and N, and rates of microbial enzyme activities) along a natural gradient in plant richness and density in high-elevation, C-deficient soils to examine the coupling between above- and belowground systems. Overall, we observed a strong positive relationship between aboveground (plant richness and density) and belowground (bacteria, fungi, and non-fungal eukaryotes) richness. In addition to the correlations between plants and soil communities, C and N pools, and rates of enzyme activities increased as plant and soil communities became richer and more diverse. Our results suggest that the theoretically expected positive correlation between above- and belowground communities does exist in natural systems, but may he undetectable in late successional ecosystems due to the buildup of legacy organic matter that results in extremely complex belowground communities. In contrast, microbial communities in early successional systems, such as the system described here, are more directly dependent on contemporary inputs from plants and therefore are strongly correlated with plant diversity and density.},

Members of the detrital food web (litter-feeders or microbivores) should presumably have greater effects on decomposition than herbivores, members of the green food web. Using litterbag experiments within a field enclosure experiment, we determined the relative effects of common litter snails (Megalomastoma croceum) and herbivorous walking sticks (Lamponius portoricensis) on litter composition, decomposition rates, and microbes in a Puerto Rican rainforest, and whether consumer effects were altered by canopy cover presence. Although canopy presence did not alter consumers' effects, focal organisms had unexpected influences on decomposition. Decomposition was not altered by litter snails, but herbivorous walking sticks reduced leaf decomposition by about 50\% through reductions in high quality litter abundance and, consequently, lower bacterial richness and abundance. This relatively unexplored but potentially important link between tropical herbivores, detritus, and litter microbes in this forest demonstrates the need to consider autotrophic influences when examining rainforest ecosystem processes.},

	abstract = {Foundation species are locally abundant and uniquely control associated biodiversity, whereas dominant species are locally abundant but are thought to be replaceable in ecological systems. It is important to distinguish foundation from dominant species to direct conservation efforts. Long-term studies that remove abundant species while measuring community dynamics have the potential to (1) aid in the identification of foundation vs. dominant species and, (2) once a foundation species is identified, determine how long its effects persist within a community after its loss. Long-term data on ant assemblages within two canopy-manipulation experimentsthe Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment (HF-HeRE) and the Black Rock Future of Oak Forests Experiment (BRF-FOFE)-provide insights into how ant assemblages change and reassemble following the loss of Tsuga canadensis or Quercus spp. Previous research documented foundation species effects on ants in the HF-HeRE for up to four years after T.canadensis loss. Six additional years of data at HF-HeRE presented for the first time here show that removal of T.canadensis resulted in taxonomic and some measures of functional shifts in ant assemblages that persisted for ten years, further supporting the hypothesis that T.canadensis is a foundation species at Harvard Forest. In contrast, ant assemblages at BRF-FOFE varied little regardless of whether oaks or other tree species were removed from the canopy, suggesting that Quercus species do not act as foundation species at Black Rock Forest. Deer and moose exclosures within each experiment also allowed for comparisons between effects on ants of foundation or dominant tree species relative to effects of large herbivores. At HF-HeRE, effects of T.canadensis were stronger than effects of large herbivores on taxonomic and functional diversity of ant assemblages. At BRF-FOFE, in contrast, effects of Quercus species were weaker than effects of large herbivores on ant taxonomic diversity and some measures of ant functional diversity. These findings illustrate the importance of distinguishing between the roles of irreplaceable foundation species and replaceable dominant ones in forested ecosystems along with other drivers of biodiversity (e.g., herbivory).},

Although historical accounts document inland flooding, little is known about how the 1861-2 storms impacted the now heavily-developed California coast. Here we show that the 1861.2 storms emplaced a deposit of beach sand up to 50 cm thick over 450 m inland within a southern California salt marsh. This deposit is unprecedented in the post-European sediments of the marsh and more extensive than that derived from any other historical event. It is comparable in scale to hurricane and tsunami washover fans in back-barrier environments along other coastlines. The presence of overwash deposits in Carpinteria suggests that the 1861.2 storm season was erosive enough to remove coastal barriers, allowing for inundation of parts of the coastline currently developed. Efforts to prepare for a recurrence of an 1861-2-like storm season should address potential coastal impacts; likewise, interpretations of past washover deposits should consider these unusually prolonged stormy periods in addition to hurricane and tsunami inundation.},

	abstract = {Long-term environmental research networks are one approach to advancing local, regional, and global environmental science and education. A remarkable number and wide variety of environmental research networks operate around the world today. These are diverse in funding, infrastructure, motivating questions, scientific strengths, and the sciences that birthed and maintain the networks. Some networks have individual sites that were selected because they had produced invaluable long-term data, while other networks have new sites selected to span ecological gradients. However, all long-term environmental networks share two challenges. Networks must keep pace with scientific advances and interact with both the scientific community and society at large. If networks fall short of successfully addressing these challenges, they risk becoming irrelevant. The objective of this paper is to assert that the biogeosciences offer environmental research networks a number of opportunities to expand scientific impact and public engagement. We explore some of these opportunities with four networks: the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network programs (ILTERs), critical zone observatories (CZOs), Earth and ecological observatory networks (EONs), and the FLUXNET program of eddy flux sites. While these networks were founded and expanded by interdisciplinary scientists, the preponderance of expertise and funding has gravitated activities of ILTERs and EONs toward ecology and biology, CZOs toward the Earth sciences and geology, and FLUXNET toward ecophysiology and micrometeorology. Our point is not to homogenize networks, nor to diminish disciplinary science. Rather, we argue that by more fully incorporating the integration of biology and geology in long-term environmental research networks, scientists can better leverage network assets, keep pace with the ever-changing science of the environment, and engage with larger scientific and public audiences.},

	abstract = {Understanding controls on net primary production (NPP) has been a long-standing goal in ecology. Climate is a well-known control on NPP, although the temporal differences among years within a site are often weaker than the spatial pattern of differences across sites. Climate sensitivity functions describe the relationship between an ecological response (e.g., NPP) and both the mean and variance of its climate driver (e.g., aridity index), providing a novel framework for understanding how climate trends in both mean and variance vary with NPP over time. Nonlinearities in these functions predict whether an increase in climate variance will have a positive effect (convex nonlinearity) or negative effect (concave nonlinearity) on NPP. The influence of climate variance may be particularly intense at ecosystem transition zones, if species reach physiological thresholds that create nonlinearities at these ecotones. Long-term data collected at the confluence of three dryland ecosystems in central New Mexico revealed that each ecosystem exhibited a unique climate sensitivity function that was consistent with long-term vegetation change occurring at their ecotones. Our analysis suggests that rising temperatures in drylands could alter the nonlinearities that determine the relative costs and benefits of variance in precipitation for primary production.},

The BCC was analyzed throughout two annual cycles by monthly samplings using the amplification and sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene by the MiSeq Illumina platform. The dominant and most diverse bacterioplankton phyla were among the more frequently reported in freshwater ecosystems, including the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. As a distinctive feature, the development of the BCC showed a cyclical temporal pattern in the two analyzed years and throughout the euphotic layer. The recurring temporal development was controlled by the strong seasonality in water temperature and thermal stratification, and by cyclical temporal changes in nutrients and, possibly, by the remarkable annual cyclical development of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton hosting bacterioplankton that characterizes Lake Garda. Further downstream analyses of operational taxonomic units associated to cyanobacteria allowed confirming the presence of the most abundant taxa previously identified by microscopy and/or phylogenetic analyses, as well as the presence of other small Synechococcales/Chroococcales and rare Nostocales never identified so far in the deep lakes south of the Alps. The implications of the high diversity and strong seasonality are relevant, opening perspectives for the definition of common and discriminating patterns characterizing the temporal and spatial distribution in the BCC, and for the application of the new sequencing technologies in the monitoring of water quality in large and deep lakes.},

	abstract = {Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing seasons and increased soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter over the next century. Past studies show that warmer soils in the growing season enhance nitrogen uptake by plants, while soil freezing in winter reduces plant uptake and ecosystem retention of nitrogen, yet the combined effects of these changes on plant root capacity to take up nitrogen are unknown. We conducted a 2-year (2014-2015) experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA to characterize the response of root damage, nitrogen uptake capacity, and soil solution nitrogen to growing season warming combined with soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter. Winter freeze-thaw cycles damaged roots, reduced nitrogen uptake capacity by 42\%, and increased soil solution ammonium in the early growing season (May-June). During the peak growing season (July), root nitrogen uptake capacity was reduced 40\% by warming alone and 49\% by warming combined with freeze-thaw cycles. These results indicate the projected combination of colder soils in winter and warmer soils in the snow-free season will alter root function by reducing root nitrogen uptake capacity and lead to transient increases of nitrogen in soil solution during the early growing season, with the potential to alter root competition for soil nitrogen and seasonal patterns of soil nitrogen availability. We conclude that considering interactive effects of changes in climate during winter and the snow-free season is essential for accurate determination of the response of nitrogen cycling in the northern hardwood forest to climate change.},

We compared marsh extent between nineteenth-century maps and modern aerial photographs across the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, and found that Chesapeake marshes have maintained their spatial extent despite relative sea level rise rates that are among the fastest in the world. In the mapped region (i.e., 25\% of modern Chesapeake Bay marshland), 94 km(2) of marsh was lost primarily to shoreline erosion, whereas 101 km(2) of marsh was created by upland drowning. Simple projections over the entire Chesapeake region suggest that approximately 100,000 acres (400 km(2)) of uplands have converted to wetlands and that about a third of all present-day marsh was created by drowning of upland ecosystems since the late nineteenth century. Marsh migration rates were weakly correlated with topographic slope and the amount of development of adjacent uplands, suggesting that additional processes may also be important. Nevertheless, our results emphasize that the location of coastal ecosystems changes rapidly on century timescales and that sea level rise does not necessarily lead to overall habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Drylands worldwide are experiencing shrub encroachment into grasslands with potential consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Climate change could increase the rate of shrub encroachment, amplify precipitation variability, and thus alter bottom-up processes for animal communities. Desert rodents are important biodiversity elements of arid grasslands and shrublands that exert strong effects on soil, vegetation, and other animal species. We used long-term data from the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico to ask whether bottom-up control of desert rodents changes across shrub encroachment gradients. Our design included spatial blocks with replicated ecological states representing transitions from black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) to honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Grassland-to-shrubland transitions did not produce degraded ecosystems, on average, with reduced net primary production or decreased rodent biomass. However, more rodent biomass was supported on unencroached grasslands following droughts whose frequency and severity may increase in southwestern United States. Hence, the observed evenness in rodent biomass across ecological states should be sensitive to climate change. The best predictors of rodent biomass also differed markedly for two trophic groups. This outcome was explained by considering core-transient dynamics. Granivores were mostly core species that regularly occurred on sites and responded to lagged net primary production at local scales, whereas folivores included transient species (especially Sigmodon hispidus) that responded to lagged precipitation at broader scales via spillover dynamics. Bottom-up processes for desert rodents across shrub invasion gradients were understood by integrating lagged responses to productivity pulses with core-transient structuring of communities.},

	abstract = {Channel transmission losses alter the streamflow response of arid and semiarid watersheds and promote focused groundwater recharge. This process has been primarily studied in dryland channels draining large areas that are displaced away from hillslope runoff generation. In contrast, small watersheds on arid piedmont slopes allow the investigation of interactive hillslope and channel processes that control the partitioning between surface and subsurface flows. In this study, we utilize high-resolution, long-term measurements of water balance components in an instrumented watershed of the Chihuahuan Desert to set up, parameterize, and test a process-based, distributed hydrologic model modified to account for channel losses. A transient method for capturing capillary effects in channels results in simulations with a reliable representation of the watershed energy balance, soil moisture dynamics, hillslope infiltration, channel transmission (or percolation) losses, and streamflow yield over the study period. The simulation also reproduces a conceptual model of hillslope infiltration-excess runoff generation linked to downstream channel percolation losses that depend on the rainfall event size. Model-derived thresholds were obtained for the amount of hillslope runoff (6 mm) and rainfall (12.5 mm) necessary for streamflow yield, such that 40\% of percolation occurs for small events that do not reach the outlet. Using a set of scenarios, we identify that hillslope infiltration controls the rainfall threshold necessary to initiate percolation, while channel infiltration affects the partitioning into percolation and streamflow yield. Thus, the connectivity along hillslope-channel pathways is deemed an essential control on the streamflow generation and groundwater recharge in arid regions with complex terrain.},

In addition to growth-defense and competition-defense trade-offs, plants must balance their response to a wide range of potential enemies including pathogens and vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. We tested for trade-offs in plant species' responses to different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species' response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing, competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community, suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility to the impacts of consumers.},

The stomatal closure point is related to xylem anatomy and vulnerability to embolism, but it also has implications for phloem transport and possibly phloem anatomy to allow sugar transport at low water potentials. Desiccation-tolerant plants that close their stomata at severe drought should have smaller xylem conduits and/or fewer and smaller interconduit pits to reduce vulnerability to embolism but more phloem tissue and larger phloem conduits compared with plants that avoid desiccation. These anatomical differences could be expected to increase in response to long-term reduction in precipitation. To test these hypotheses, we used tridimensional synchroton X-ray microtomograph and light microscope imaging of combined xylem and phloem tissues of 2 coniferous species: one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) and pinon pine (Pinus edulis) subjected to precipitation manipulation treatments. These species show different xylem vulnerability to embolism, contrasting desiccation tolerance, and stomatal closure points. Our results support the hypothesis that desiccation tolerant plants require higher phloem transport capacity than desiccation avoiding plants, but this can be gained through various anatomical adaptations in addition to changing conduit or tissue size.},

EC-based observations of snow sublimation compared well with simulated snow sublimation at stations dominated by surface and canopy sublimation, but blowing snow sublimation in alpine areas was not well captured by the EC instrumentation. Water balance calculations provided an important validation of simulated sublimation at the watershed scale. Simulated snow sublimation across the study area was equivalent to 28\% of winter precipitation on average, and the highest relative snow sublimation fluxes occurred during the lowest snow years. Snow sublimation from forested areas accounted for the majority of sublimation fluxes, highlighting the importance of canopy and sub-canopy surface sublimation in this region. Simulations incorporating the effects of tree mortality due to bark-beetle disturbance resulted in a 4\% reduction in snow sublimation from forested areas. Snow sublimation rates corresponding to climate warming simulations remained unchanged or slightly increased, but total sublimation losses decreased by up to 6\% because of a reduction in snow covered area and duration.},

To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.},

These include primary trophic levels of mosses, algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and their protozoan and metazoan consumers (including relatively few species of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, and microarthropods). These biota are patchily distributed across the landscape, with greatest faunal biodiversity associated with wet soil. Understanding trophic structure is critical to studies of biotic interactions and distribution; yet, McMurdo Dry Valley soil food web structure has been inferred from limited laboratory culturing and microscopic observations. To address this, we measured stable isotope natural abundance ratios of C (C-13/C-12) and N (N-15/N-14) for different metazoan taxa (using whole body biomass) to determine soil food web structure in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Nitrogen isotopes were most useful in differentiating trophic levels because they fractionated predictably at higher trophic levels. Using N-15/N-14, we found that three trophic levels were present in wet soil habitats. While cyanobacterial mats were the primary trophic level, the nematode Plectus murrayi, tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus, and rotifers composed a secondary trophic level of grazers. Eudorylaimus antarcticus had a N-15/N-14 ratio that was 2-4 parts per thousand higher than that of grazers, indicating that this species is the sole member of a tertiary trophic level.

Additive and synergistic impacts of physical stress on consumer control appear more common, for example, for herbivory versus predation, and for warm-versus cold-blooded consumers.

It is less clear how human activities have affected the diversity of habitats these consumers occupy. Rebounding populations of some predators after conservation provides an opportunity to begin to investigate this question. Recent research shows that following longterm protection, sea otters along the northeast Pacific coast have expanded into estuarine marshes and seagrasses, and alligators on the southeast US coast have expanded into saltwater ecosystems, habitats presently thought beyond their niche space. There is also evidence that seals have expanded into subtropical climates, mountain lions into grasslands, orangutans into disturbed forests and wolves into coastal marine ecosystems. Historical records, surveys of protected areas and patterns of animals moving into habitats that were former hunting hotspots indicate that - rather than occupying them for the first time - many of these animals are in fact recolonizing ecosystems. Recognizing that many large consumers naturally live and thrive across a greater diversity of ecosystems has implications for setting historical baselines for predator diversity within specific habitats, enhancing the resilience of newly colonized ecosystems and for plans to recover endangered species, as a greater range of habitats is available for large consumers as refugia from climate-induced threats.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition is influenced by and modulates biogeochemical processes, yet DOM characterization techniques are challenged by its heterogeneous properties and structures. In this paper, ultrahigh electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry is used to characterize previously isolated and well-characterized four DOM fractions from a water reservoir in the southwestern part of the USA. About 50-60 L water samples were collected from Lake Pleasant (a water reservoir of Colorado River) and isolated and fractionated using a sequential isolation and fractionation procedure. DOM was firstly fractionated to the colloids and soluble permeate, then hydrophobic acids (HPO-A) and neutrals (HPO-N) plus amphiphilic acids (AMP-A) and neutrals (AMP-N) were fractionated using the resin-in-tandem procedure. Approximately 0.7 mg sample was dissolved in 250 mu L methanol/water mixture (1:1, v/v) and diluted twice with 0.1 \% (by volume) NH4OH (in 1:1 methanol/water, v/v) and measured by ESI-FTICR in negative ion mode. In the m/z range of {\textless} 700, among the sum of 4107 peaks, HPO-N contained the most assigned 1763 molecules and HPO-A, AMP-N, and AMP-A contained 971, 990, and 293, respectively. Acid fractions were relatively more oxygenated than the corresponding neutrals. Except for the major assigned CHO molecules, a high portion of heteroatom-containing molecules were assigned in the neutral fractions. Van Krevelen and Venn diagrams analyses showed significant molecular differentiation among the fractions. Among the assigned formulas, the Venn diagram indicated only a small portion ({\textless} 4 \%) of distinct formulas overlapped. S-containing molecules were efficiently ionized and identified in the neutrals. Some of the S-1-containing compounds with high signal magnitudes are tentatively assigned to alkylbenzene sulfonates and their biodegradation and biotransformation derivatives indicating anthropogenic input on site. By using the XAD resin-in-tandem approach and FTICR-MS, numbers of DOM molecules in fractions were distinctly separated, accordingly the complexity of DOM was reduced. Furthermore, to a great extent, the compositions and structures of each fraction in the molecular level are remarkably different as evidenced by only small portion of molecules overlapping.},

The lake is divided into two lobes - East Lobe Bonney (ELB) and West Lobe Bonney (WLB), each with unique temperature and salinity profiles. Most of our data were collected in November 2009 from WLB to examine the influence of the Taylor Glacier on the structure of the water column. Temperatures adjacent to the glacier face between 20 m and 22 m were 3 degrees C colder than in the rest of WLB, due to latent heat transfer associated with melting of the submerged glacier face and inflow of cold brines that originate beneath the glacier. Melting of the glacier face into the salinity gradient below the chemocline generates a series of nearly horizontal intrusions into WLB that were previously documented in profiles measured with 3 cm vertical resolution in 1990-1991. WLB and ELB are connected by a narrow channel through which water can be exchanged over a shallow sill that controls the position of the chemocline in WLB. A complex exchange flow appears to exist through the narrows, driven by horizontal density gradients and melting at the glacier face. Superimposed on the exchange is a net west-to-east flow generated by the higher volume of meltwater inflows to WLB. Both of these processes can be expected to be enhanced in the future as more meltwater is produced.},

	abstract = {Runaway expansion of shallow ponds can catalyze the conversion of vegetated marshes into open water environments. Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.},

Ten species were identified in two 0.1 ha plots. Nyssa aquatica (Tupelo Gum) made up 50\% of the density and 57\% of the total basal area. Nyssa biflora, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica were the next dominant species, collectively accounting for 37\% of the density and 26\% of the total basal area. Taxodium distichum only accounted for 3\% of the density, but 12\% of the total basal area. Aboveground productivity, measured as litterfall and stem wood growth, averaged 927 and 1030 g/m(2) in 2015 and 2016, respectively, with litterfall accounting for 60\% of the total. Tidal forest soils in the streamside and the interior (0-60 cm) contained 3-6\% organic C, 0.20-0.40\% N, and 270-540 mu g/g P. Soil accretion based on Cs-137 was 4.0 mm/year on the streamside and 0.2 mm/year in the forest interior. The rate of accretion in the interior is considerably less than the current rate of sea level rise (3.1 mm/year) along the Georgia coast. Because the accretion rate was much higher on the streamside, rates of C sequestration, N and P accumulation, and mineral sediment deposition also were much greater. Low accretion rates in the interior of the forest that accounts for most of the acreage suggests that accelerated sea level rise is likely to lead to foreseeable death of tidal forests from saltwater intrusion and submergence.},

	abstract = {Particles and aggregates created in the surface layers of the ocean are transported not only by gravity, but also by the horizontal and vertical advection of the surrounding water. Subduction, in particular, can transport organic matter from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic in a manner that is not likely to be detected by typical in situ carbon export measurements (e.g., sediment traps and U-238-Th-234 disequilibrium). To assess the importance of subduction to the biological pump, we combined in situ sediment trap, thorium, primary productivity, and particulate organic carbon (POC) measurements with a data-assimilative physical circulation model and a Lagrangian particle tracking model. We develop a simple parameterization of two alternative particle sinking processes (Phytoplankton-Fecal Pellet [PFP] and Aggregation) using results from 13 extensively sampled water parcels in the California Current Ecosystem. Both parameterizations suggested that subduction is an important, at times dominant, mechanism of POC vertical export in the region (median 44\% and 23\% contribution to total POC export for PFP and Aggregate parameterizations at the 100-m depth horizon). The percentage contribution of subduction was highly variable across water parcels (ranging from 7\% to 90\%), with subduction typically more important in offshore, oligotrophic regions. On average the fate of particles that are passively transported out of the surface layer by advection is different from that of particles that sink across the 100-m depth horizon. Subducted particles were predominantly remineralized shallower than 150 m, while approximately 50\% of gravitationally exported POC was remineralized at depths {\textgreater} 500 m.},

Samples were collected from mixed layers of 4 North Pacific ecosystems: the California Current (CCE), Equatorial Pacific, Costa Rica Dome, and subtropical gyre (station ALOHA). Both nano- (2-20 mu m) and microphytoplankton (20-200 mu m) in creased biomass as power functions with increasing richness, with a sharper slope leading to microphytoplankton dominance at high biomass. The AC: chl a ratio (mu g:mu g) was also well fit by a power function, varying from similar to 170 to 20 over the range of {\textless}0.06 to {\textgreater}11.7 mu g chl a l(-1). Prochlorococcus and diatoms were major biomass contributors at poorer and richer extremes, respectively, but mixed flagellates (prymnesiophytes, dinoflagellates, others) comprised a surprisingly consistent half of AC over the richness range. While pico- ({\textless}2 mu m) and nanophytoplankton co-dominated at low chl a, all picophytoplankton (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes) declined significantly in richer coastal waters. Their decrease was consistent with a previously proposed mechanism linking Prochlorococcus decline to increased productivity and grazing pressure on heterotrophic bacteria, termed here the enhanced microbial loop hypothesis. Generalized additive models further indicated that biotic variables explained more of picophytoplankton variability than abiotic variables in CCE coastal waters. Density-independent grazing may be a strong driver of picophytoplankton selection across trophic gradients, with implications for strategy trade-offs in growth rate and grazing resistance, and for representing mortality in marine ecosystem models.

We found that transient species are a general feature of communities regardless of taxa or ecosystem. The proportion of these species decreases with increasing spatial scale leading to a need to control for scale in comparative work. Removing transient species from analyses influences the form of a suite of commonly studied ecological patterns including species-abundance distributions, species-energy relationships, species-area relationships, and temporal turnover. Careful consideration should be given to whether transient species are included in analyses depending on the theoretical and practical relevance of these species for the question being studied.},

Nevertheless, urban flux observations are limited, particularly in arid climates, given the wide variety of land cover present in cities. To help address this need, a mobile eddy covariance tower was deployed at three locations in Phoenix, Arizona, to sample the surface energy balance at a parking lot, a xeric landscaping (irrigated trees with gravel) and a mesic landscaping (irrigated turf grass). These deployments were compared to a stationary eddy covariance tower in a suburban neighborhood. A comparison of the observations revealed key differences between the mobile and reference sites tied to the urban land cover within the measurement footprints. For instance, the net radiation varied substantially among the sites in manners consistent with albedo and shallow soil temperature differences. The partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes was modulated strongly by the presence of outdoor water use, with the irrigated turf grass exhibiting the highest evaporative fraction. At this site, we identified a lack of sensitivity of turbulent flux partitioning to precipitation events, which suggests that frequent outdoor water use removes water limitations in an arid climate, thus leading to mesic conditions. Other urban land covers with less irrigation, however, exhibited sensitivity to the occurrence of precipitation, as expected for an arid climate. As a result, quantifying the frequency and magnitude of outdoor water use is critical for understanding evapotranspiration losses in arid urban areas.},

New research is required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R-2) changes when habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in local (a) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.},

	abstract = {The retrospective study of abrupt and sustained increases in the radial growth of trees (hereinafter 'releases') by tree-ring analysis is an approach widely used for reconstructing past forest disturbances. Despite the range of dendrochronological methods used for release-detection, a lack of in-depth comparison between them can lead researchers to question which method to use and, potentially, increases the uncertainties of disturbance histories derived with different methods. Here, we investigate the efficacy and sensitivity of four widely used release detection methods using tree-ring width series and complete long-term inventories of forest stands with known disturbances. We used support vector machine (SVM) analysis trained on long-term forest census data to estimate the likelihood that Acer rubrum trees experiencing reductions in competition show releases in their tree-ring widths. We compare methods performance at the tree and stand level, followed by evaluation of method sensitivity to changes in their parameters and settings. Disturbance detection methods agreed with 60-76\% of the SVM-identified growth releases under high canopy disturbance and 80-94\% in a forest with canopy disturbance of low severity and frequency. The median competition index change (CIC) of trees identified as being released differed more than two-fold between methods, from - 0.33 (radial-growth averaging) to - 0.68 (time-series). False positives (type I error) were more common in forests with low severity disturbance, whereas false negatives (type II error) occurred more often in forests with high severity disturbance. Sensitivity analysis indicated that reductions of the detection threshold and the length of the time window significantly increased detected stand-level disturbance severity across all methods. Radial-growth averaging and absolute-increase methods had lower levels of type I and II error in detecting disturbance events with our datasets. Parameter settings play a key role in the accuracy of reconstructing disturbance history regardless of the method. Time-series and radial-growth averaging methods require the least amount of a priori information, but only the time-series method quantified the subsequent growth increment related to a reduction in competition. Finally, we recommend yearly binning of releases using a kernel density estimation function to identify local maxima indicating disturbance. Kernel density estimation improves reconstructions of forest history and, thus, will further our understanding of past forest dynamics.},

We measured soil chemistry (total N, C, extractable PO4, soil pH, cation exchange capacity [ECEC], percent base saturation [\% BS]) and dissected soil fungal communities using ITS2 metabarcode Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Total soil N, C, PO4, \% BS, and pH increased with elevation and plateaued at approximately 1400 m, whereas ECEC linearly increased and C/N decreased with elevation. Fungal communities differed among locations and were correlated with all chemical variables, except PO4, whereas OTU richness increased with total N. Several ecological guilds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae, saprotrophs, plant pathogens) differed in abundance among locations; specifically, saprotroph abundance, primarily attributable to genus Mortierella, was positively correlated with elevation. Ectomycorrhizae declined with total N and soil pH and increased with total C and PO4 where plant pathogens increased with total N and decreased with total C. Our results demonstrate significant turnover in taxonomic and functional fungal groups across elevational gradients which facilitate future predictions on forest ecosystem change in the southern Appalachians as nitrogen deposition rates increase and regional temperature and precipitation regimes shift.},

	abstract = {Top-down control exerted by macroconsumers can strongly affect lower trophic levels and ecosystem processes. Studies of effects on primary consumers in streams have been focused on algae, and effects on bacteria are largely unknown. We manipulated the density of an omnivorous, grazing minnow, the central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum), in experimental stream mesocosms (treatments with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 individuals) to understand consumer effects on algal and bacterial abundance (chlorophyll a [Chl a] extraction, bacterial cell counts, biomass measurements) and bacterial diversity and community composition (via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene). Increasing C. anomalum density reduced algal biomass until density reached similar to 2 fish (5 g fish biomass/m(2)), and higher fish densities did not affect algal biomass. Fish biomass did not affect bacterial cell counts. Biofilm organic matter decreased with increasing C. anomalum biomass. Bacterial community composition was not affected by fish biomass, but variation in community composition was correlated with shifts in bacterial abundances. Evenness of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased with increasing C. anomalum biomass, indicating that bacterial communities exhibited a greater degree of OTU dominance when fish biomass was higher. These findings suggest that this grazing fish species reduces algal abundance and organic matter in low-nutrient streams until a threshold of moderate fish abundance is reached and that it reduces evenness of benthic bacterial communities but not bacterial biomass. Given the importance of biofilm bacteria for ecosystem processes and the ubiquity of grazing fishes in streams, future researchers should explore both top-down and bottom-up interactions in alternative environmental contexts and with other grazing fish species.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. A lack of understanding of its distribution and structures in the environment limits the design of effective P mitigation and recovery approaches. Here we developed a robust method employing size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to an ICP-MS to determine the molecular weight (MW) distribution of P in environmental samples. The most abundant fraction of P varied widely in different environmental samples: (i) orthophosphate was the dominant fraction (93-100\%) in one lake, two aerosols and DOC isolate samples, (ii) species of 400-600 Da range were abundant (74-100\%) in two surface waters, and (iii) species of 150-350 Da range were abundant in wastewater effluents. SEC-DOC of the aqueous samples using a similar SEC column showed overlapping peaks for the 400-600 Da species in two surface waters, and for {\textgreater}20 kDa species in the effluents, suggesting that these fractions are likely associated with organic matter. The MW resolution and performance of SEC-ICP-MS agreed well with the time integrated results obtained using conventional ultrafiltration method. Results show that SEC in combination with ICP-MS and DOC has the potential to be a powerful and easy-to-use method in identifying unknown fractions of P in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The tradeoff between foraging behavior and predation risk may result in a trophic cascade that can have important effects on ecosystem processes. For herbivores that can feed both above- and below-ground, it is likely that predation risk affects the location of feeding. We tested whether two species of predatory marsh crabs affected feeding behavior of the herbivorous crab, Sesarma reticulatum. We found that predatory crabs could kill or injure Sesarma and that Sesarma did less damage to its food plant Spartina alterniflora in the presence of the more dangerous predator. Sesarma prefers to feed on and grows better on belowground rhizomes than aboveground leaves; however, the costs of digging burrows to access rhizomes lead to higher mortality if it is the only diet option. The location of feeding did not affect total biomass of S. alterniflora. For Sesarma, a choice in feeding location allows the crabs the behavioral flexibility to balance the risks of predation, the nutritional benefit of feeding belowground, and the survival costs of belowground feeding. Similar tradeoffs are likely to increase the success of other herbivores that can feed both above-and belowground.},

	abstract = {Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality-water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms-can become uncoupled during a food web shift.},

This study classifies and evaluates LCZs for two arid desert cities in the Southwestern United States - Phoenix and Las Vegas - following the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) method. Both cities are classified into seven built type LCZs and seven land-cover type LCZs at 100-m resolution using Google Earth, Saga GIS, and Landsat 8 scenes. Average surface cover properties (building fraction, impervious fraction, pervious fraction) and sky view factors of classified LCZs are then evaluated and compared to pre-defined LCZ representative ranges from the literature, and their implications on the surface UHI (SUHI) effect are explained. Results suggest that observed LCZ properties in arid desert environments do not always match the proposed value ranges from the literature, especially with regard to sky view factor (SVF) upper boundaries. Although the LCZ classification scheme was originally designed to describe local climates with respect to air temperature, our analysis shows that much can be learned from investigating land surface temperature (LST) in these zones. This study serves as a substantial new resource laying a foundation for assessing the SUHI in cities using the LCZ scheme, which could inform climate simulations at local and regional scales.(C) 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Remote sensing has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems based on the varying spectral properties of different species or functional groups. However, the most appropriate spatial resolution necessary to detect diversity remains unclear. At coarse resolution, differences among spectral patterns may be too weak to detect. In contrast, at fine resolution, redundant information may be introduced. To explore the effect of spatial resolution, we studied the scale dependence of spectral diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. Our study involved a scaling exercise comparing synthetic pixels resampled from high-resolution images within manipulated diversity treatments. Hyperspectral data were collected using several instruments on both ground and airborne platforms. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space as the indicator of spectral diversity and then compared CV at different scales ranging from 1mm(2) to 1m(2) to conventional biodiversity metrics, including species richness, Shannon's index, Simpson's index, phylogenetic species variation, and phylogenetic species evenness. In this study, higher species richness plots generally had higher CV. CV showed higher correlations with Shannon's index and Simpson's index than did species richness alone, indicating evenness contributed to the spectral diversity. Correlations with species richness and Simpson's index were generally higher than with phylogenetic species variation and evenness measured at comparable spatial scales, indicating weaker relationships between spectral diversity and phylogenetic diversity metrics than with species diversity metrics. High resolution imaging spectrometer data (1mm(2) pixels) showed the highest sensitivity to diversity level. With decreasing spatial resolution, the difference in CV between diversity levels decreased and greatly reduced the optical detectability of biodiversity. The optimal pixel size for distinguishing diversity in these prairie plots appeared to be around 1mm to 10cm, a spatial scale similar to the size of an individual herbaceous plant. These results indicate a strong scale-dependence of the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationships, with spectral diversity best able to detect a combination of species richness and evenness, and more weakly detecting phylogenetic diversity. These findings can be used to guide airborne studies of biodiversity and develop more effective large-scale biodiversity sampling methods.},

Here, we examined the relative contributions of species richness, evenness, and composition to the spectral reflectance, and consider factors confounding the remote estimation of species diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota. We collected hyperspectral reflectance of 16 prairie species using a tram-mounted imaging spectrometer, and a full-range field spectrometer with a leaf clip, and simulated plot-level images from both instruments with different species richness, evenness and composition. Two optical diversity metrics were explored: the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space and classified species derived from Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a spectral classification method. Both optical diversity metrics (CV and PLS-DA classified species) were affected by species richness and evenness. Diversity metrics that combined species richness and evenness together (e.g. Shannon's index) were more strongly correlated with optical diversity than either metric alone. Image-derived data were influenced by both leaf traits and canopy structure and showed larger spectral variability than leaf clip data, indicating that sampling methods influence optical diversity. Leaf and canopy traits both contributed to optical diversity, sometimes in complex or contradictory ways. Large within-species variation sometimes confounded biodiversity estimation from optical diversity, and a single species markedly altered the optical-biodiversity relationship. Biodiversity estimation from CV was strongly influenced by soil background, while estimation from PLS-DA classified species was not sensitive to soil background. These findings are consistent with recent empirical studies and demonstrate that modeling approaches can be used to explore effects of spatial scale and guide regional studies of biodiversity estimation using high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing.},

We measured open water diurnal O-2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics seasonally in a salt marsh-estuary in Georgia, U.S.A. with a focus on the marsh-estuary linkage associated with tidal flooding. We observed that the overall estuarine system was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere and coastal ocean and a net sink for oceanic and atmospheric O-2. Rates of metabolism were extremely high, with respiration (43 mol m(-2) yr(-1)) greatly exceeding gross primary production (28 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), such that the overall system was net heterotrophic. Metabolism measured with DIC were higher than with O-2, which we attribute to high rates of anaerobic respiration and reduced sulfur storage in salt marsh sediments, and we assume substantial levels of anoxygenic photosynthesis. We found gas exchange from a flooded marsh is substantial, accounting for about 28\% of total O-2 and CO2 air-water exchange. A significant percentage of the overall estuarine aquatic metabolism is attributable to metabolism of marsh organisms during inundation. Our study suggests not rely on oceanographic stoichiometry to convert from O-2 to C based measurements when constructing C balances for the coastal ocean. We also suggest eddy covariance measurements of salt marsh net ecosystem exchange underestimate net ecosystem production as they do not account for lateral DIC exchange associated with marsh tidal inundation.},

Some birds engage in between-year breeding dispersal, but the factors shaping variation in this behavior are not well understood. In mid-continental grasslands, preliminary evidence suggested that Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) dispersed not only between seasons, but also within breeding seasons-an apparently uncommon avian behavior. We studied a population of Grasshopper Sparrows breeding in northeastern Kansas, USA, to document the spatial and temporal patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in an experimentally managed tallgrass prairie from 2013 to 2015. We combined color-band resighting, territory mapping, and radio telemetry to quantify changes in territory density, turnover of territorial males, and dispersal distances. Density of Grasshopper Sparrows varied seasonally in management-specific ways, simultaneously increasing and decreasing in watersheds that differed in management regime. Turnover was unexpectedly high, with over half of territorial males being replaced each month. We documented over a third of males dispersing up to similar to 9 km between breeding attempts. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in a grassland songbird. Our results reveal the remarkable prevalence of within-season movement in this system and the relatively large distances over which birds disperse. Such mobility has important implications for survey design and habitat management, as birds select habitat at much larger spatial scales than is generally appreciated. These results also provide foundational information for tests of alternative hypotheses explaining the ecological and evolutionary basis for such movements.},

We analyzed three 50-year high-quality daily temperature records representing different elevations and aspects to assess changes in snowmaking conditions during important snowmaking periods. The analysis provides context for discussing the historical relationships between temperatures, water, and snowmaking infrastructure. There was significant warming of winter temperatures over the 50-year record, notably strongest at the early portion of the snowmaking season, especially in the weeks between 1 December and 25 December. While the rates of warming were comparable on both north- and south-facing aspects, the implied reduction in days suitable for snowmaking in each period was always lowest on the north-facing aspect as the mean temperatures on this aspect were farther below the snowmaking threshold. Daily average temperatures of -2 degrees C and -5 degrees C were both explored as thresholds for snowmaking. The implied reduction in snowmaking opportunity during the 1 November to 25 December period using a -2 degrees C snowmaking threshold at the north-facing site was 20\%, while the implied reduction for the entire season for that site was 8.5\%. This decrease in opportunity for snowmaking, especially in the economically important early season, suggests an increasing need for large volumes of water to make snow in less time, given that holiday vacations are fixed in time. Analysis of snowmaking operations at Loon Mountain Resort suggest that modern snowmaking investments there have outpaced the pressure from climate warming to date, but this has concentrated demand for water into smaller time frames.},

We conducted a survey to learn about current practices in reporting uncertainties in precipitation, streamflow, soils, and vegetation. Uncertainty derives from natural variation, which is commonly characterized by replicate samples, and from imperfect knowledge, which includes measurement error and model error (model fit and model selection). We asked questions about whether researchers report uncertainties in these sources, whether they know how to do so, and how important they believe the sources to be. We also asked questions about identifying missing or unusable values, filling gaps in data, and dealing with analytical concentrations below detection limits. We obtained responses from 140 researchers representing 90 research sites around the world. Natural variation was the most important source of uncertainty in calculations of biomass and soil pools, according to respondents in these fields, and sampling error was the source they most often reported. In contrast, uncertainty in the chemical analysis of precipitation and stream water was the source most commonly reported by hydrologists, although they rated this one of the least important sources of uncertainty to calculations of hydrologic flux. Awareness of types of uncertainty can help identify sources of uncertainty that may have been overlooked, and quantifying them will help determine which sources are most important to report.},

Foliar concentrations of Hg averaged 16.3 ng g(-1) among the hardwood species, which was significantly lower than values in conifers, which averaged 28.6 ng g(-1) (p {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, bark concentrations of Hg were lower (p {\textless} 0.001) in hardwoods (7.7 ng g(-1)) than conifers (22.5 ng g(-1)).

In this study, a functional gene array (i.e., GEOCHIP 4.2) was used to analyze the functional capacities of soil microbial communities collected from a naturally degrading permafrost region in Central Alaska. Varied thaw history was reported to be the main driver of soil and plant differences across a gradient of minimally, moderately, and extensively thawed sites. Compared with the minimally thawed site, the number of detected functional gene probes across the 15-65 cm depth profile at the moderately and extensively thawed sites decreased by 25\% and 5\%, while the community functional gene beta-diversity increased by 34\% and 45\%, respectively, revealing decreased functional gene richness but increased community heterogeneity along the thaw progression. Particularly, the moderately thawed site contained microbial communities with the highest abundances of many genes involved in prokaryotic C degradation, ammonification, and nitrification processes, but lower abundances of fungal C decomposition and anaerobic-related genes. Significant correlations were observed between functional gene abundance and vascular plant primary productivity, suggesting that plant growth and species composition could be co-evolving traits together with microbial community composition. Altogether, this study reveals the complex responses of microbial functional potentials to thaw-related soil and plant changes and provides information on potential microbially mediated biogeochemical cycles in tundra ecosystems.},

	abstract = {An understanding of surface and subsurface water contributions to streamflow is essential for accurate predictions of water supply from mountain watersheds that often serve as water towers for downstream communities. As such, this study used the end-member mixing analysis technique to investigate source water contributions and hydrologic flow paths of the 264km(2) Boulder Creek Watershed, which drains the Colorado Front Range, USA. Four conservative hydrochemical tracers were used to describe this watershed as a 3 end-member system, and tracer concentration reconstruction suggested that the application of end-member mixing analysis was robust. On average from 2009 to 2011, snowmelt and rainwater from the subalpine zone and groundwater sampled from the upper montane zone contributed 54\%, 22\%, and 24\% of the annual streamflow, respectively. These values demonstrate increased rainwater and decreased snow water contributions to streamflow relative to area-weighted mean values derived from previous work at the headwater scale. Young water (2.3 +/- 0.8months) fractions of streamflow decreased from 18-22\% in the alpine catchment to 8-10\% in the lower elevation catchments and the watershed outlet with implications for subsurface storage and hydrological connectivity. These results contribute to a process-based understanding of the seasonal source water composition of a mesoscale watershed that can be used to extrapolate headwater streamflow generation predictions to larger spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Trees serve as a valuable asset in the urban built environment. In an arid city like Phoenix, trees are one of the primary urban green infrastructures to ameliorate extreme heat stress. Because of the cost of water and space in the desert residential environment, designing the optimal tree arrangement to maximize overall thermal benefits for residential neighborhoods is important and necessary. In this research, we first simulated a real neighborhood with current tree arrangement in ENVI-met (a holistic three-dimensional model for the simulation of surface-plant-air interactions), and validated the reliability of ENVI-met models by comparing the simulated results with systematic temperature collection transects. Further, we evaluated and compared differences in outdoor microclimates and human thermal comfort by simulating different tree layouts (clustered, equal interval, or dispersed) in the same neighborhood. Tree benefits at individual building scale and neighborhood scale are also compared and discussed. Based on the simulation, an equal interval two trees arrangement provided the most microclimate and human thermal comfort benefits in the neighborhood due to the importance of shading in the hot arid desert environment, following by clustered tree arrangement without canopy overlap. These findings will help policy makers and urban planners offer better guidelines for planting and establishing residential trees to mitigate extreme heat in the hot arid residential environment.},

	abstract = {Interannual changes in global climate and weather disturbances may influence reproduction in tropical forests. Phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are known to produce interannual variation in reproduction, as do severe storms such as hurricanes. Using stationary trap-based phenology data collected fortnightly from 1993 to 2014 from a hurricane-affected (1989 Hugo, 1998 Georges) subtropical wet forest in northeastern Puerto Rico, we conducted a time series analysis of flowering and seed production. We addressed (1) the degree to which interannual variation in flower and seed production was influenced by global climate drivers and time since hurricane disturbance, and (2) how long-term trends in reproduction varied with plant lifeform. The seasonally de-trended number of species in flower fluctuated over time while the number of species producing seed exhibited a declining trend, one that was particularly evident during the second half of the study period. Lagged El Nino indices and time series hurricane disturbance jointly influenced the trends in numbers of flowering and fruiting species, suggesting complex global influences on tropical forest reproduction with variable periodicities. Lag times affecting flowering tended to be longer than those affecting fruiting. Long-term patterns of reproduction in individual lifeforms paralleled the community-wide patterns, with most groups of lifeform exhibiting a long-term decline in seed but not flower production. Exceptions were found for hemiepiphytes, small trees, and lianas whose seed reproduction increased and then declined over time. There was no long-term increase in flower production as reported in other Neotropical sites.},

	abstract = {Global change-induced litter decomposition strongly affects the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in grassland ecosystems. However, few studies show the interactive effects of global change factors on litter and root decomposition. We conducted a four-year grassland field experiment to examine the quality and decomposition of litter and root in a three-factorial experiment with elevated CO2, increased N deposition, and plant species richness. We found that elevated CO2 decreased the litter N content and root lignin content. N addition increased the root N content and decreased the litter lignin content. Increasing plant richness decreased the N and lignin contents in litter and root. In contrast to the quality changes, elevated CO2 had no effect on decomposition of litter and root. N addition increased the C loss of the litter by 4.8\%, but did not affect C and N loss in root. Increasing plant richness affected the C and N loss in litter and root. ANCOVAs showed that tissue quality and root biomass affected the C and N loss in litter and root, and soil C and N affected the N loss of litter and root. However, changes in tissue quality, biomass, and soil as covariates did not significantly change the effects of CO2, N, and plant richness on decomposition. The structural equation model showed that elevated CO2 indirectly decreased litter N loss and increased root N loss, while N addition indirectly increased the C and N loss in litter and root, via their effects on tissue quality. Increasing plant richness increased litter C and N loss, but indirectly decreased root C and N loss. N deposition can accelerate litter and root decomposition, thus modifying the limitation of elevated CO2 on soil N availability. Biodiversity loss greatly alters litter and root decomposition, potentially driving any changes in C and N cycling. Our study clearly demonstrates a relative certainty of a predicted increase in the C loss and N release in litter and root decomposition with increased N deposition, whereas the effects of elevated CO2 and plant diversity changes on decomposition strongly differ between litter and root in grassland ecosystems.},
